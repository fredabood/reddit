Never in culinary history has such a combination been discovered. As said by Amadeus and then by Marshal, \"Just ice cream? Just a pint of ice cream, this is so much more than 'just ice cream'. I mean...that first bite-oh what heaven that first bite is. The vanilla, like a sea of sweet cream and sugar, paired with flowing rivers of caramel, flavors mingling in the seductive pas de deux. And then a waffle cone! The most playful little waffle cone! An ice cream so exquisite, swirling in your mouth, breaking apart, and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savor so delightful.
