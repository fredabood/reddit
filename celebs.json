      "What an incredible story. Thank you for sharing. You're right - Danny is a good man (one of the best), and I know he will love to hear that some of his advice helped you become a great man, although I can tell you always had it in you. I'm going to send this to him so he can see it.",
      "Can confirm. But as much as I love photo-bombing, this was not a photo-bomb. I was doing a photo shoot for GQ Germany, and I asked that we do it in public in Venice instead of in a stiff, boring studio. The photos ended up with a lot of fans in them, which was fun, and a lot of people who planned a normal day of being a tourist in Venice saw me running and biking around Muscle Beach and the boardwalk in different outrageous outfits, which I hope was fun for them. \n\nEDIT: Please stop attacking the poor guy. His story is true - his friend was probably part of the group that was surprised to see me show up. It was just not a true photo bomb!",
      "Just seeing this. Great memories but here is the reality. \n\n\nWorking with John Milius was fantastic, because he was so hardcore.\n\nBut it is true that he thought I looked too much like a bodybuilder - I needed to lose some of the cuts because I had just won Mr. Olympia and I was way too ripped to be a barbarian. So he told me to eat normally and not diet at all - I let my body fat get to around 12%.\n\nI had no issue with swinging swords even before I changed my body. I had been training with Sensei Yamazaki for three years before we filmed. I'd also been training in kendo and horseback riding for those three years by the time we filmed. Reps, reps, reps. \n\nI knew I had gotten good with the sword when James Earl Jones let me hit him right in the neck on the bloodbag even though if I'd missed by a couple inches I could have hit his head or his ear. His neck had a protective leather cover under the bloodbag and I didn't miss. \n\nI got attacked by a dog on the very first day of shooting - he pulled me down from the rocks into a thorn bush and I had to be stitched up on the set. Milius walked up to me and said \"this sets the tone\" - he meant this in a positive way.\n\nAlso, it is true that I had to bite a real dead vulture because in those days they couldn't make one that would look good in a close-up. So they soaked it in alcohol to kill bacteria and dried it out. It still had lice.",
      "Someone told me about this. I hope I'm not too late here, I'm traveling, but I wanted to chime in.\n\nI always say don't be afraid of failure, because how far can you really fall? You found out - to the ground. It's right there. Now you know it isn't anything that should scare you. \n\nYou should be proud that you weren't afraid - not embarrassed that you failed. You could have made excuses not to walk into the door, but you didn't. You knew it would be hard, and it would be uncomfortable, and it might be awkward - and you did it anyway. That's courage.\n\nI'm proud of you.\n\nThe last guy I rooted for broke a world record in the deadlift. You have more in common with him than you think.\n\nFirst, he started out lifting just the bar, too (when you look at him, he may have been 3 months old at that point). Second, imagine his courage. He walked up to that bar in front of a big audience and television cameras, knowing that not only had he never lifted that much before - NO ONE on earth had - and it was highly likely he would completely fail. You may not think about it this way, but you showed that courage, on a smaller level.\n\nFinally, I'm rooting for you, too. You took the first step and you fell, but at least you fell in the right direction, so get back up and take the next step. Keep moving forward.\n\n",
      "Thanks for sharing this. \n\nEverybody, behave and stop bickering. This is about inspiring more people to get into fitness. I've never understood people who argue constantly about who is wrong and who is right in fitness, because the fact is, there are many \"right\" answers, especially for people just starting out. \n\nDo you think Sergio Oliva and I did the same thing? No. In fact, you could walk into Gold's and watch the 5 best guys and see 5 completely different routines. And you know what? We didn't argue.\n\nDo me a favor. Try to focus more on expanding the fitness community as a whole than protecting your little corner of it. ",

      "When I went to this gym in Budapest, the owner told me he knew someone who had my 1969 Mr. Universe weight class trophy. So I asked my team to check in the office back in LA, and it turned out that trophy was missing. This wasn't strange to me. I gave some of my trophies to my mother and friends after contests, because I was always looking ahead and didn't worry about trophies. And sometimes they would hand us a trophy to pose with and then take it away. So this guy, Lorand Berke, who is a bench press champion, apparently had visited my mother and she was so excited that a fan came, she had just given it to him. I'm pumped up to get it back.  \n",

Let's get together soon and share sword stories.\n\n",
      "Thank you for sharing! You beat me to it because I'm in London!\n\nLast year I learned that the more fun I have promoting after-school all-stars, the more fun you have watching and the more you get engaged. So it's my Trojan horse - I do ridiculous things and have a great time, but I get you to pay attention to something really close to my heart. This isn't a vanity project - I know the power of after-school programs in kids' lives and that's why I started After-School All-Stars more than 25 years ago. I've talked to teachers, police officers, parents, and most importantly, the kids themselves and I've never seen such unanimous agreement. But still, some politicians mess around with the funding because the kids don't have a high-paid lobbyist like all of the adults do and their parents are too busy working to fight - 70% of households include two working parents, so 70% of our kids lack the supervision and growth and love from 3-6pm that they deserve and need. Our biggest responsibility is to our kids but they are unquestionably the most underrepresented in our capitols so we end up spending lots of our money on the adults, on the present and the past, and not on our kids, the future. That's why I fly to Washington every time they talk about cutting the after-school funding to make sure they don't screw over the kids. But whatever you do, please don't call me a lobbyist.\n\nLast year, I also realized that you guys here at reddit are the most powerful ally I could have in my crusade for after-school programs. The fact is, I have quite a platform. I can talk about this in the 20 interviews I'm doing about Terminator today and post to Facebook and Twitter, but even I can't do this alone. And when I join forces with you guys, great things happen. Last year, we raised millions and millions of dollars and 1.1 million dollars with our Omaze campaign alone. This year, I want to do better. I will match you guys up to $500,000.\n\nI will do every fun and ridiculous thing I can do to elevate the issue. All you have to do is join me. All of you have something to give. If you can't spare the 10 dollars to donate, give your time - teach kids sports or technology, read with them, or just hang out and let them know you care. You can find our programs at www.afterschoolallstars.org or you can volunteer at whatever program is near you.\n\nIf you do have 10 dollars, enter and come to the premiere with me. I'll bring the schnapps and I promise we will have a good time. www.omaze.com/terminator.\n\nThanks again.",
      "Redistricting reform isn't a sexy issue, so it is wonderful to see this here. I LOVE to see all of these upvotes for this issue. Thank you, reddit! \n\nI can't tell you how important this is to me, and the most important thing is making sure everybody knows about it - which you are all doing. Anytime you see the things that poll higher than Congress - like lice or hemorrhoids - you have to wonder how we re-elect over 90% of our representatives every two years. It's because the system is rigged to benefit the politicians instead of the voters.\n\nAfter California's reform, we saw real turnover in our congressional delegation for the first time in 2012. Incumbents actually lost - to members of their own party and to the other party. It doesn't matter what party you vote for, as long as we keep sending the most extreme politicians to Washington, the gridlock will continue. Stopping gerrymandering helps to prevent safe districts that often encourage extremism.\n\nI hope this is just the start of some serious momentum for reform all over the country. Thanks again for sharing it.\n",

      "The most important thing is that we need to be a party that is inclusive and tolerant. We can be those things and be the party we always have been. We need to think about the environment - Teddy Roosevelt was a great environmentalist and people forget Reagan was the one who dealt with the ozone layer with the Montreal protocol. We also need to talk about healthcare honestly - Nixon almost passed universal healthcare. We need to have an talk about immigration and realize you can't just deport people. We need a comprehensive answer. We also need to stay out of people's bedrooms. The party that is for small government shouldn't be over-reaching into people's private lives. \n\nMainly, we need to be a party where people know what we are for, not just what we are against.",

      "Thanks for posting. I saw the mention from /u/SetYourGoals and wanted to share. The point isn't the machines or the exercises. The point is that you can create a workout for your goals anywhere. Even if you just use a chair for dips, a table for rows, and the floor for pushups. \n\nTo answer the question further, I enjoy working out in unfamiliar gyms, even though sometimes I would prefer to be at home doing t-bar rows. But I like shocking my system, so I look at the bright side.\n\nAnd I am guessing you are wondering if it is possible to workout without being interrupted. It is, because generally in a gym people are very respectful and focused on themselves. Occasionally you see someone with their iPhone pointed at you, pretending to text even though the phone is at eye level. I always wonder why those people would rather take blurry shots of me than say hi while I'm resting, and possibly get a better photo with me once I've finished, as long as I have time.\n\nBut yes, short version, people are mostly good. And if you ever see me, say hi, but don't slow me down while I'm working. Tell me you're from reddit once I've finished my workout and I will take a photo with you. \n\nUPDATE: this happened today, and since we were talking about how hotel gyms might be different for me, it was too funny not to share: http://imgur.com/a/HGW3h",

Yes, I just mentioned that username. And thanks to all of you who have supported After-School All-Stars with either donations or ideas of what I could crush.\n\nWe're ending the contest on Friday. I've mostly joked around in my promotion, but this is a serious issue. After-school programs have been close to my heart for more than 20 years. If you look at the crime statistics for kids between 3 and 6, you understand why after-school programs are so important. We're giving a safe-haven to some of our most vulnerable kids during the most dangerous part of the day. Instead of letting them be pulled away by bad influences, we keep them in a program that their parents don't have to pay a dime for. There is nothing more worthwhile.\n\nLearn more here: www.afterschoolallstars.org, and enter here: www.omaze.com/Arnold. Your 10 dollar donation gives a kid 2 days of programs, and if that doesn't do it for you, you get a chance to hang out with me and ride in my tank.\n\nI'll try to check in throughout the day, and trust me, after 3 hours of crushing things, I'll deliver some unedited footage and deleted scenes before Friday.\n\n",

      "I have two from movies. \n\nOn The 6th Day, there was a scene where I hide underwater behind embryos. I did a rehearsal with goggles and everything went fine. But when we actually shot, I couldn't see because the water was milky. So I ran out of air and went to the top and realized I didn't know where to get out. I was trapped. Then a hand grabbed me and pulled me out. It was my stunt double, Billy Lucas. He'd been watching from below with a tank and goggles and realized I was in big, big trouble.\n\nOn True Lies, you probably remember the horse scene. There was a shot where the horse had to stop at the edge of a building.  They built a little ramp to give the horse longer to stop. But when they were measuring the new distance from the ramp to the camera, they dropped the arm of the camera on the horse's nose, and it went crazy, spinning and rearing. There was no rail, and the ramp was only 4 feet wide. I realized it was a bad situation and I slid off the horse right away and a stunt man grabbed me. That one was really scary. If the horse stepped a foot the wrong way, we would have fallen 90 feet to a cement floor. \n\nThese stories are why I will always love stunt people.",

      "A: Stay with the firm until you find your passion. But stay with me here.\nB: How do you know right now your passion isn't something that you will need money for? Maybe you will decide you want to start a healthy burger shop. You will need money.\n\nSo look at this as a stepping stone instead of an end. We can't always do what we are passionate about, but everything we do can move us closer to our passion. I was never passionate about construction. But I laid bricks and worked so I could support my passion when I was starting out in bodybuilding. \n\nThe most important thing is, you need to find your passion. And once you do, put everything into it. Everything. But until then, it sounds like you are at a good stepping stone. Just remind yourself to think of it that way and don't let yourself think of it as the end point. You sound like a smart guy. I bet you will do great once you have somewhere to direct this energy.",

      "Actually, the story is a little different. I wanted the role of Kyle Reese when we went to lunch. I did not want to be the Terminator. I didn't think I had established myself yet enough as a hero to be a villain. When I started in Hollywood, all they offered was villains. So I wanted to really establish myself first.\n\nBut I told Jim some of my ideas about how the Terminator should train (not looking while loading weapons, not blinking, no emotions. I said the guy had to train blindfolded.) The Terminator, by the way, at that time, was O.J. Simpson.\n\nJim told me I had to do it. He was right.",

Never stop learning and challenging yourself. \n\nIf you do those three things, you eliminate most complaints - about your job and your health. And you won't be bored. If you are always challenging yourself, you're always climbing the mountain, so there is nothing to be negative about because it is a work in progress.

And this has to be my last one.\n\nEven though Congress has an approval rating of 9% (and loses to cockroaches and colonoscopies in polling), there are still some leaders who are doing the people's work instead of the partys' work.

      "I had to come back to answer this one. First of all, it was in Munich. I have always loved a good prank, and this one was one of my favorites. The guy was a little wild. We mostly pranked the guys who showed up huffing and puffing and acting tough. So this guy was already saying he was going to win the competition. I told him that the new trend in posing was sound effects. The higher your arms are, the higher the pitch of the scream. As you get lower, you drop your voice. I told him not to worry about the reaction, this was the big thing in America and England and Germany would catch up. By maybe the fourth scream, he was dragged off stage and thrown out the back door. There were no repercussions for him, except some embarrassment. \n\nAnother great one was the time we oiled up a tough guy who wanted to squat with us. He literally waited for me by the squat rack for 12 hours on two days until I came to squat. He knew I would be there at some point because I squatted that frequently. When I put on 135 to warm up, he called it chicken weight. Then as I gradually moved the weight up, to 225, 315, etc. he said we were doing it wrong and we were going to get worn out. When we got to 405, he finally said, now you're at my weight. I told him we planned to take photos and asked if he wanted to join us. Of course there was no camera. So he took off his shirt and we really oiled up his traps. Then we said we should keep working out until it was time for the photo. He only did a half rep (he was one of those guys who did twice the weight he should have and didn't do full reps), but when he came up, because of the oil, the weight was 2 inches lower. On his second rep, the weight slid completely off and we caught it so he wouldn't get hurt. I said, \"You should really warm up next time.\" After that, he never made fun of us for our warm-up, and he even joined in.\n\nI also pulled pranks on my best friends, like the time Franco had just arrived in America and I greeted him with a marijuana cookie. He was fresh off the plane and I wanted to be a little cautious so I only gave him half. I took him to my friends' apartment and they couldn't figure out why we spent an hour lying on their floor laughing. They only knew Franco's reputation as the strongest man in the world, so they were shocked. Franco had a great time but didn't know why. I finally told him a few days later.\n\nSo there's a short history of my bodybuilding pranks. Thanks again. I really had a great time. I will have to pop in from time to time to chat with you guys some more. Who said we had to limit it to one hour?",

For each group, you have to have your hook that pulls them in. \n\nHere is an example: when I fought for Proposition 49 in CA, which funds after-school programs, I wanted the endorsement of both parties. For Democrats, you talk about how good this is for working families. My fellow Republicans were not fans. So I met with Dave Cox, who was a really conservative guy but also a serious leader. I told him to think of it as being fiscally responsible, spending a dollar to save 3 dollars in the future on crime and social services. He liked that, and he went to his caucus and gave a fiery speech about spending money upstream instead of downstream. It worked. \n\nI am going into an event at the Forest Service but I will check back on before my meetings at the House and Senate.

      "I started After-School All-Stars more than 25 years ago. When I was the chairman of the President's Council on Fitness, I traveled to every single state. I saw that kids had nowhere to go between 3 and 6, and the more I learned about it, the more I realized there was a serious problem. Gang violence, teen pregnancy, it all skyrockets in that time when kids are unsupervised.\n\nEvery dollar we spend on these programs saves us about 9 dollars down the line in prison costs and increased productivity. But still, we always need money. In California, I helped push Prop 49 which funds after-school programs, but mosts states don't have anything like that.\n\nKids don't have lobbyists working in the state capitols. Everyone else does, so they grab the money and then there is nothing for the kids. I have had to go to Washington to lobby to stop them from eliminating the billion dollars for this program several times. Imagine - just a billion dollars! So every time I hear Congress is cutting it, I head back and have meetings. I can't find an article right now, but I am sure someone can post. I've posted my op-eds on reddit, so maybe someone can find them.\n\nThere are 20 million kids who would be in an after-school program if they were available. I want to keep expanding to help as many kids as we can. Just to give you an idea, it takes about 7 dollars per kid per year. Last year, you guys helped me raise more than a million dollars. Do the math.\n\nI found Omaze, and I thought I have a tank, I have access to things that other people don't. I can use this to raise money. As passionate as I am about After-School All-Stars and programs in general, I know to some people it is boring. So I make it fun. You might not read an op-ed I write about after-school funding, but you will definitely watch a video of me blowing things up or pretending to train people in the gym!\n\nI'd really appreciate you guys checking out www.afterschoolallstars.org to learn more.

      "Thanks for asking. I answered something along these lines in r/politics. This is what I said:\n\nDespite my views on electoral reform, environmental policies and social issues, I am conservative. I’m worried about government spending beyond its means, I’m worried about our debt, I’m worried about regulations that make it hard for people to start businesses without 18 permits and 3 professional licenses, and I’m worried at the state and city level about bad pension promises crowding out education and other spending. I’m not a “No Tax Pledge” Republican, but I am a “We better make damn sure every dollar we collect is spent wisely” Republican. And by the way, I’d note that my environmental views are in line with the party’s history - Nixon created the EPA, Reagan created CARB in CA and fought for the Montréal Protocol to deal with the ozone as President, and Bush 41 dealt with acid rain. As for gerrymandering? I don’t see how it is a partisan issue. Anyone who defends it, like the Michigan GOP in this case, must be forgetting that if they lose power, the other side will pull the same trick. I can even make an argument that every free-market loving Republican should support reform. If your ideas aren’t good enough to win without a fixed “market” of voters, well, that’s how a market works. Better fix the product, or in this case, party, so that you can compete.\n\nHere's the full comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8vo7u9/schwarzenegger\\_takes\\_hit\\_at\\_michigan\\_gop\\_for/e1qjvn1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/8vo7u9/schwarzenegger_takes_hit_at_michigan_gop_for/e1qjvn1/)\n\nBasically, what you consider Democratic views, I consider people's issues. The environment was not always political. I also support huge infrastructure investment, which was never political. And both parties fought my redistricting reform and open primaries, so everybody disagrees with me there. And my views on education reform clash completely with most Democratic politicians I know. I think it's crazy that tenure kicks in after two years, making you a teacher for life, and I think too much money goes to the adults in the system instead of to the kids in the classrooms. \n\nBut generally, my politics confuse people because I think politicians should look at the best idea regardless of parties, and more and more people are locked into ideological corners. In my second inaugural, I said: \"Centrist does not mean weak. It does not mean watered down or warmed over. It means well-balanced and well-grounded. The American people are instinctively centrist- so should be their government.\" I still believe that.",

      "Trust me, I hear this over and over. \n\nI know it disappoints my Democratic friends, but I’m not leaving. I have been a Republican since I moved to this country - I joined the party of Lincoln, Roosevelt, and Reagan. It’s going through a wacky period, and I disagree with a lot of it. So I’m trying to use my platform to change that. \n\nPlus, if we abandon the party to the people currently running it, what does that say about us? If somebody breaks into your house and eats all of your food, you don’t just move out and leave them the house. You reclaim it. And believe me, there will be a reclaiming.\n\nUntil there are open primaries, redistricting reform, and campaign finance reform all over the country, a new party will be a major scramble from the start. So I choose to stay and fight.\n\nAnd I think you’d prefer it if I stay where I am. Despite my views on electoral reform, environmental policies and social issues, I am conservative. I’m worried about government spending beyond its means, I’m worried about our debt, I’m worried about regulations that make it hard for people to start businesses without 18 permits and 3 professional licenses, and I’m worried at the state and city level about bad pension promises crowding out education and other spending. I’m not a “No Tax Pledge” Republican, but I am a “We better make damn sure every dollar we collect is spent wisely” Republican. And by the way, I’d note that my environmental views are in line with the party’s history - Nixon created the EPA, Reagan created CARB in CA and fought for the Montréal Protocol to deal with the ozone as President, and Bush 41 dealt with acid rain. As for gerrymandering? I don’t see how it is a partisan issue. Anyone who defends it, like the Michigan GOP in this case, must be forgetting that if they lose power, the other side will pull the same trick. I can even make an argument that every free-market loving Republican should support reform. If your ideas aren’t good enough to win without a fixed “market” of voters, well, that’s how a market works. Better fix the product, or in this case, party, so that you can compete.\n\nI understand your frustration, but I do not believe the answer is every reasonable Republican becoming a Democrat. Right now, I can talk to Republicans who share my concerns and I can use my platform to talk about clean energy and redistricting reform. \n\nAs for the person who talked about taking action further down - I vote. I am usually fairly public about that. I’ve never believed that belonging to a party means blindly voting for everyone else who does. I’m also part of New Way California with a group of younger, problem solving legislators here who share a different vision for the party. It will take time. But we will reclaim it and then you and I can go back to politely disagreeing.",

      "Here are two.\n\nJoe knew I wanted to get into acting, and he knew I was working hard, going to English classes. So he acted like my agent. And when a producer called for Hercules in New York (it was called Hercules Goes Bananas at that time) asking for a bodybuilder who could act, Joe said he had the guy. Then he brought me to the meeting, and before we went inside, he said, \"Arnold, don't say a word. Don't open your mouth.\" He went on and on selling me, but my favorite part was that he claimed I was a German Shakespearean actor. As far as I know, there is no such thing. But I got the role.\n\nAnother one was when I convinced him to bring Franco to the United States. Franco was always my training partner and I knew and explained to Joe that besides helping me, Franco would be a star in his own right. Well, Franco got really sick on the way over, and lost 20 pounds his first few weeks here. So suddenly the \"great bodybuilder\" I asked Joe to bring was 150 pounds. Joe would come by our apartment to see him and I would hide Franco every day. He was like a fugitive. Once we nursed him back to health they met and Joe was happy to have another bodybuilder around who wasn't \"lazy.\"",

      "1. I think what I meant was in developing land - the opportunities are there, you just have to be creative. If you see a hill, and you can visualize the community and then have the follow through to see it through with the permits and architects. If you have that kind of vision, you can double or triple your investment. When you can see an apartment building being torn down and you buy the land and turn it into a better building with a mix of low income and high income housing - that's vision.\n\nIf you're just starting out, a small building with several units so that the rent of others pays your debt until you can trade it in and move up is a great launchpad. Always moving toward the next building, the big vision. But if you're creative and look, there is land to be developed.\n\n2. If you want to have a meditative workout, you have to get rid of the iPhone, the iPad, and everything. Including listening to music. You also have to eliminate the small talk and the gossip. When you go into the gym, nothing comes with you. No worries, no text messages, no emails. When you are in there, it is just you, your body, and the weight. The focus has to be completely on lifting, on the muscles you know you're targeting. You can do that for an hour. Focusing completely, you'll find, is meditative. Only when you remove everything can you get your mind completely into the calf, the biceps, the traps. In an hour. you can check your phone and talk about the weather, but not now. \n\nIf you notice be people who are busiest with their phones or conversation... They look accordingly. \n\nIf you can't clear your mind, I recommend practicing some form of meditation until you've learned to be mindful.

      "There are many domains to be successful in. I was a success in getting good grades and test scores in high school. I was a success at writing good code by my early 20s. The dream of the PC being an enabling tool came true by the 1990s. Now I am working on being a good father and the ambitious goals of the  Foundation including getting rid of polio and malaria. I think it is always good to have goals where your success is in doubt and I have that in many areas including the work I do on climate change.",
      "I will look into this. How many empires do you need?",
      "When I code I use tabs because you want the columns to line up. For some word documents I use tabs. You want things to adjust when you go back and edit them and tabs help.\n\n",
      "I sometimes wear a hat. For example when I did college tours with my son I wanted the focus to be totally on him. A lot less people recognize me when I have a hat on or else they realize I am trying to be incognito.\n\nMostly when people do recognize me they are super nice so I don't feel it is a burden to be noticed most of the time.\n\n",
      "Since our Foundation can basically save a life for every $1,000 we spend I would pick it up since that would be enough to save 40 lives which is a big deal.",
      "The most amazing thing will be when computers can read and understand the text like humans do. Today computers can do simple things like search for specific words but concepts like vacation or career or family are not \"understood\". Microsoft and others are working on this to create a helpful assistant. It has always been kind of a holy grail of software particularly now that vision and speech are largely solved. Another frontier is robotics where the human ability to move and manipulate is amazing and experts disagree on whether it will take just a decade or a lot longer (Brooks) to achieve the equivalent.",
      "The big milestone is when computers can read and understand information like humans do. There is a lot of work going on in this field - Google, Microsoft, Facebook, academia,... Right now computers don't know how to represent knowledge so they can't read a text book and pass a test.\n\nAnother whole area is vaccines. We need a vaccine for HIV, Malaria and TB and I hope we have them in the next 10-15 years.",
      "I do make myself tomato soup sometimes. It is kind of a comforting food and reminds me of doing the same when I was growing up. I don't make sandwiches much.",
      "I would explain that smartness is not single dimensional and not quite as important as I thought it was back then. I would say you might explore the developing world before you get into your forties. I wasn't very good socially back then but I am not sure there is advice that would fix that - maybe I had to be awkward and just grow up....",
      "There was a certain urgency to everything we were doing to stay ahead that meant the speed of activity was very high. I miss this a bit. I had to take Think Weeks twice a year just to step back and see what the longer term trends were. Now I work on things like malaria where I wish there was more competition to solve the problems and things moved faster.",
      "I think that health care costs, education and poverty/mobility deserve a lot more thinking and innovation than they get today. The benefit of getting these things right would be amazing.\nWith all the talk about inequity it is interesting that we still work on vertical areas like health, education, housing, food, etc.. as separate things rather than having a full view of the challenges someone faces.\n",
      "The main feature of crypto currencies is their anonymity. I don't think this is a good thing. The Governments ability to find money laundering and tax evasion and terrorist funding is a good thing. Right now crypto currencies are used for buying fentanyl and other drugs so it is a rare technology that has caused deaths in a fairly direct way. I think the speculative wave around ICOs and crypto currencies is super risky for those who go long.",
      "Allocating time is always tough. Tennis is a big hobby for me and I try and play twice a week (a bit more in the summer). I always try and read a few books every month and a bunch on vacation. Melinda and I look over our schedules a lot to make sure we are balancing things well. I travel about 1/3 of the time for the Foundation which I enjoy.",

      "No. ",
      "Philanthropy is small as a part of the overall economy so it can't do things like fund health care or education for everyone. Government and the private sector are the big players so philanthropy has to be more innovative and fund pilot programs to help the other sectors. A good example is funding new medicines or charter schools where non-obvious approaches might provide the best solution.\n\nOne thing that is a challenge for our Foundation is that poor countries often have weak governance - small budgets, and the people in the ministries don't have much training. This makes it harder to get things done.\n\nIf we had more money we could do more good things - even though we are the biggest foundation we are still resource limited.\n\n**Edit:** We discuss this in our annual letter this year: www.gatesletter.com",
      "GMO foods are perfectly healthy and the technique has the possibility to reduce starvation and malnutrition when it is reviewed in the right way. I don't stay away from non-GMO foods but it is disappointing that people view it as better.",

      "A lot of people feel a sense of isolation. I still wonder if digital tools can help people find opportunities to get together with others - not Tinder but more like adults who want to mentor kids or hang out with each other. It is great that kids go off and pursue opportunities but when you get communities where the economy is weak and a lot of young people have left then something should be done to help.",

      "For the Foundation reducing childhood death and malnutrition and ending polio would be the biggest 3 things. For innovation it would be an energy breakthrough and improving the way we educate kids. For my family it is making sure the kids are ready to go to college and have a great experience there. That is more than 3 and I didn't mention my tennis goals yet.\n\n",
      "Melinda and Warren are my two favorites followed by Bono. Most celebrities I don't know very well. I do get to meet a lot of political leaders and Nelson Mandela was the most impressive ever. Jimmy Carter is also amazing.",
      "I haven't seen any concrete proposal on how you would do the regulation. I think it is worth discussing because I share the view of Musk and Hawking that when a few people control a platform with extreme intelligence it creates dangers in terms of power and eventually control.",
      "This is a great question. I felt sure that allowing anyone to publish information and making it easy to find would enhance democracy and the overall quality of political debate. However the partitioning you talk about which started on cable TV and might be even stronger in the digital world is a concern. We all need to think about how to avoid this problem. It would seem strange to have to force people to look at ideas they disagree with so that probably isn't the solution. We don't want to get to where American politics partitions people into isolated groups. I am interested in anyones suggestion on how we avoid this.",
      "Good question. I think having parents and teachers reinforce your curiosity and explain what they are fascinated with makes a big difference. A lot of people lose their curiosity as they get older which is a shame. One thing that helps nowadays is that if you get confused about something it is easier than ever to find an article or video to make things clear.",
      "I think people's spending instincts are set when they are in high school. I don't like spending a lot of money on clothes or jewelry (for me - I do like to buy nice things for my wife).",
      "Although the Foundation work is super promising and will be the biggest thing over the decades ahead I still think the chance to be part of the software revolution empowering people was the biggest thing I have gotten to do.\n\nRight now I am very focused on making sure we successfully [eradicate polio](https://www.gatesnotes.com/2017-Annual-Letter#ALChapter8) - that will be amazing if we do it - as good as shipping even the best software product.",
      "There have been a lot of failed Alzheimer's drug trials. The good news is that the new tools we have are helping us understand the disease far better - for example the role of the glial cells. I am optimistic that in the next 20 years we will have drugs to help if we stay focused on it including pooling data and helping start ups get funded. I am involved in a number of these areas.\n",
      "Automation has been driving productivity ever since the industrial revolution including things like tractors and garment making. With software this will continue to accelerate so we need to think about how we educate people for the new jobs that will emerge. Overall automation is a great thing - eventually we won't have to work as much but we are still at least a generation away from a big change there.\n\n",
      "I spent a month learning the math behind Quantum computing with help from the Microsoft team and a lot of online course material. I wanted to understand how Quantum computers could factor numbers so much faster than normal computers. It is amazing how the matrix math with complex numbers works - nature is doing arbitrary computation but it is tricky to access. These are early days but yes Microsoft is making large investments in quantum - particularly in handling the error problems that most approaches have.",
      "I am concerned about biological tools that could be used by a bioterrorist. However the same tools can be used for good things as well.\n\nSome people think Hoverboards were bad because they caught on fire. I never got to try one.",
      "Sometimes you just get very lucky based on the configuration. I forget the exact time but I think I had a time below 10 when it was just right.",
      "I won't be running for President because I am super committed to the work Melinda and I are doing at the Foundation and outside the Foundation. I agree it is important to have a President who thinks long term about the US role in the world and the research to solve disease burdens and costs and to tackle climate change and improve education.\n\nI do think people are expecting too much from Government. Yes Government can do better but local groups can do a lot that government can't - helping out in schools, reaching out to people in poverty. This is also true internationally. I would like to see this civil society sector step up a lot more. Some issues like abortion or even immigration we may never get a consensus on but there are things like better health and better education that we can achieve.",
      "I still find the creation of life and the way the brain works the most fascinating areas. [Nick Lane](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Vital-Question) has some great books exploring what we know about how life started. It is amazing how little we know about the brain still but I expect we will know a lot more in 10 years.",
      "The main \"copying\" that went on relative to Steve and me is that we both benefited from the work that Xerox Parc did in creating graphical interface - it wasn't just them but they did the best work. Steve hired Bob Belville, I hired Charles Simonyi. We didn't violate any IP rights Xerox had but their work showed the way that led to the Mac and Windows.\n\n",
      "We need clean, reliable cheap energy - which we don't have. It is too bad the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. The Economist had a good piece on this this week. So we need some invention - perhaps miracle batteries or super safe nuclear or making sun into gasoline directly.",
      "The problem of how we prevent a small group of terrorists using nuclear or biological means to kill millions is something I worry about. If Government does their best work they have a good chance of detecting it and stopping it but I don't think it is getting enough attention and I know I can't solve it.\n\nI love both sushi and thai food. Since I like them better than my family does I have them for lunch a lot.",
      "Australia is particularly nice. It is summer there when it is winter here so going there in December and January is especially nice. I spent Thanksgiving there last year.\n\nI have gotten to travel to a lot of great places like the Amazon in Brazil which I recommend.",
      "It seems pretty egocentric while we still have malaria and TB for rich people to fund things so they can live longer. It would be nice to live longer though I admit.",
      "I will mention three things. \n\nFirst is an energy innovation to lower the cost and get rid of green house gases. This isn't guaranteed so we need a lot of public and private risk taking.\n\n **EDIT:** I talked about this recently in my annual letter: https://www.gatesnotes.com/2016-Annual-Letter\n\nSecond is progress on disease particularly infectious disease. Polio, Malaria, HIV, TB, etc.. are all diseases we should be able to either eliminate of bring down close to zero. There is amazing science that makes us optimistic this will happen.\n\nThird are tools to help make education better - to help teachers learn how to teach better and to help students learn and understand why they should learn and reinforce their confidence.",
      "I decided that I would be different and never attend any class I was signed up for but always attend a class I wasn't signed up for. This worked out in a funny way when the final exam for a Combinatorics class (which I signed up for) was given at the same table as my Brain studies class (which I attended and did not sign up for). My friends from Brain studies thought it was very strange that I sat on the wrong side of the table and took the Combinatorics exam even when I was the most vocal student in the Brain class.",
      "A shorter chair every decade I am afraid.",
      "I feel pretty stupid that I don't know any foreign languages. I took Latin and Greek in High School and got A's and I guess it helps my vocabulary but I wish I knew French or Arabic or Chinese. I keep hoping to get time to study one of these - probably French because it is the easiest. I did [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) for awhile but didn't keep it up. Mark Zuckerberg amazingly learned Mandarin and did a Q&A with Chinese students - incredible.",
      "I studied super hard during reading period and almost always got A's. The big exception was organic chemistry where the promised video tapes of the lectures sometimes had no sound or no video - that spooked me and I ended up getting a C+ in the course!",
      "Don't die...",
      "Thanks!",
      "Vaccines make the top of the list. Being able to grow up healthy is the most basic thing. So many kids get infectious diseases and don't develop mentally and physically. I was in Berlin yesterday helping raise $7.5B for vaccines for kids in poor countries. We barely made it but we did which is so exciting to me!",
      "The stork.",
      "I am pretty basic when it comes to clothes and food. My big splurge is having a plane to fly around in. \n\nI play tennis so I invest in shoes and racquets to help but they don't make a big difference.",
      "It is quite a coincidence but my gift arrived this morning. I got three cool things - a great quilt that a group of people did with a Snoo on it. A great jug of maple syrup and the book The Promise of a Pencil. All very thoughtful. Last year I waited and nothing came. \n\n**EDIT:** More to come soon: http://i.imgur.com/pg8ZbLQ.jpg\n&nbsp;\n\n**EDIT 2:** Reddit just let me know that I did get a gift last year: a generous donation to [Heifer International](http://www.heifer.org/), a great non-profit that helps fight poverty and hunger around the world. So, thank you /u/SailorKingCobra, my Secret Santa!&nbsp;\n\n**EDIT 3:** I’m jumping back into the thread to thank /u/bfarnsey for the generous gifts. The quilt is amazing! /u/sillygirlsarah made it in just a week—I don’t know a ton about quilting, but I understand that’s really fast. The Snoo on there is a very nice touch. To show my appreciation, the quilt is being featured as my cover photo on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BillGates) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/BillGates).\n\nThe Promise of a Pencil looks interesting. It touches on two key areas: improving education in the developing world and inspiring talented young people to get involved with global issues. Adam Braun’s story is a good one and I’m eager to learn more.\n\nWho doesn’t love maple syrup? Especially from Vermont. A nice personal touch given that this is the kind /u/bfarnsey grew up with.\n\nThanks again to a terrific Secret Santa.",
      "Free software. Just kidding.\n\nBooks actually.",
      "Bitcoin is an exciting new technology. For our Foundation work we are doing digital currency to help the poor get banking services. We don't use bitcoin specifically for two reasons. One is that the poor shouldn't have a currency whose value goes up and down a lot compared to their local currency. Second is that if a mistake is made in who you pay then you need to be able to reverse it so anonymity wouldn't work.\n\nOverall financial transactions will get cheaper using the work we do and Bitcoin related approaches.\n\nMaking sure that it doesn't help terrorists is a challenge for all new technology.",
      "Don't stay up too late even if the book is really exciting. You will regret it in the morning. I am still working on this problem.",
      "Melinda would probably watch that version.",
      "It would be nice if all governments were as rational as the Nordic governments - reaching compromise and providing services broadly. The Economist had a nice special section on this last week.

      "I like my current job at the Foundation better than I would being President. Also I wouldn't be good at doing what you need to do to get elected. I thought Michael Bloomberg was thoughtful about why it didn't make sense for him to try and run even though he is a great executive.",
      "I am in the camp that is concerned about super intelligence. First the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent. That should be positive if we manage it well. A few decades after that though the intelligence is strong enough to be a concern. I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people are not concerned.",

      "I tried to answer as many questions as I could, but I’ve got to go. I do have one question for you: How can we help more people understand that foreign aid isn’t 25% or even 10% of the U.S. federal budget, but less than 1%?",
      "Owning a plane is a  guilty pleasure. Warren Buffett called his the Indefensible. I do get to a lot of places for Foundation work I wouldn't be able to go to without it.",

      "Technology is not making people less intelligent. If you just look at the complexity people like in Entertainment you can see a big change over my lifetime. Technology is letting people get their questions answered better so they stay more curious. It makes it easier to know a lot of topics which turns out to be pretty important to contribute to solving complex problems.",
      "Yes - anonymous cash is used for these kinds of things but you have to be physically present to transfer it which makes things like kidnapping payments more difficult.",
      "It is safe for now! It is also a lot of fun and helps shape your thinking on all issues to be more logical. There is a prospect for change in this area for the next generation but that is true for most fields and understanding how to program will always be useful.",
      "Wow. That is a nice thing to ask. I wish the debate about education would focus on helping teachers improve and what we know about that. Right now it is caught up in state versus federal and testing versus no-testing. In general politics needs to focus on the problems rather than attacking the other side.  Asian countries are helping their teachers improve and the impact is huge.",
      "I first saw a computer when I was 13 and it fascinated me then. I spent a lot of time figuring out what programming was - first Basic and then machine language. By the time I was 16 I got a job programming at TRW which helped me learn even more (skipping part of my senior year). So I was lucky to have something I loved to do and which became more important in the years ahead. I have had self-doubts about all of my skills but programming is one I have always had a lot of confidence in.",

      "The foundation is involved in digital money but unlike Bitcoin it would not be anonymous digital money. In Kenya M-pesa is being used for almost half of all transactions. Digital money has low transaction costs which is great for the poor because they need to do financial transactions with small amounts of money. Over the next 5 years I think digital money will catch on in India and parts of Africa and help the poorest a lot.

      "I love playing tennis. I am an avid bridge player (a card game if you have not heard of it - it was more popular in the past!). I like to tour interesting things with my kids like power plants, garbage dumps, the Large Hadron Collider, Antarctica, missile Silos (Arizona),... I read a lot and watch courses (online or the Learning Company)..",
      "It is super important to improve our healthcare system - both to reduce chronic disease but if we don't do better health costs will squeeze out spending on all other government functions.\n\nI agree it is surprising how tough it has been to get digital medical records right and to learn from looking at those records.\n\nStill there are some very promising things going on. For example the idea of looking at a blood sample to find cancer very early so it can be treated. We will be able to use genomic data to tune treatments.\n\nThere are a few big problems like diabetes, obesity and neurological conditions including Alzheimer's that we really need to solve.",
      "I am glad you kept it!",
      "There will be more progress in the next 30 years than ever. Even in the next 10 problems like vision and speech understanding and translation will be very good. Mechanical robot tasks like picking fruit or moving a hospital patient will be solved. Once computers/robots get to a level of capability where seeing and moving is easy for them then they will be used very extensively.\n\nOne project I am working on with Microsoft is the Personal Agent which will remember everything and help you go back and find things and help you pick what things to pay attention to. The idea that you have to find applications and pick them and they each are trying to tell you what is new is just not the efficient model - the agent will help solve this. It will work across all your devices.",
      "Its called shorting a stock.",
      "Less than I used to. It was part of exercise for snow skiing. I still ski but I am not as hard core...",
      "I’m a big tennis fan so when I heard about “Battle of the Sexes,” I couldn’t wait to see it. The movie was so good, I asked my friend Elisabeth Shue (who plays Bobby Riggs’ wife Priscilla) to recreate this famous photo with me last month at the US Open.",
      "I will be 76 at that time. Hopefully a grandfather. The Foundation with its partners will have eradicated a number of diseases and health in poor countries will be a lot better - specifically instead of 5% of children under 5 dying it should be at 2.5% which is still a lot.\n\nI hope I can still type fast enough to do Reddit sessions without someone transcribing for me.",
      "Not as much as I would like to. I write some C, C# and some Basic. I am surprised new languages have not made more progress in simplifying programming. It would be great if most high school kids were exposed to programming...",
      "My favorite of the last decade in Pinker's Better Angels of our Nature. It is long but profound look at the reduction in violence and discrimination over time. I review a lot of the books I read at gatesnotes.com (is that too self-promotional? http://b-gat.es/12GKLyN) ",
      "I think the private market rewards innovation in this space quite well. I think electric cars and autonomous vehicles will be great things. The Foundation is experimenting with drone delivery of medical supplies with a grantee in Rwanda and Tanzania. I am not sure the hyperloop concept makes sense - making it safe is hard.",
      "Just creating an innovative company is a huge contribution to the world. During my 20's and 30's that was all I focused on. Ideally people can start to mix in some philanthropy like Mark Zuckerberg has early in his career. I have enjoyed talking to some of the Valley entrepreneurs about this and I am impressed and how early they are thinking about giving back - much earlier than I did.",
      "I think there needs to be a discussion about when the government should be able to gather information. What if we had never had wiretapping? Also the government needs to talk openly about safeguards. Right now a lot of people don't think the government has the right checks to make sure information is only used in criminal situations. So this case will be viewed as the start of a discussion. I think very few people take the extreme view that the government should be blind to financial and communication data but very few people think giving the government carte blanche without safeguards makes sense. A lot of countries like the UK and France are also going through this debate. For tech companies there needs to be some consistency including how governments work with each other. The sooner we modernize the laws the better.",
      "Weezer.... Actually U2 is a favorite.. I keep waiting for Spinal Tap to go back on tour...",
      "This is a sensitive topic. The idea was that men don't like the current design so perhaps something they would be more open to would allow for less HIV transmission. We still haven't gotten the results. One grantee is using carbon nanotubes to reduce the thickness,",
      "I make sure we pick ambitious scenarios and that we have a strong architecture to deliver on them. I encourage good work (hopefully).",
      "I would say education is the key problem. If you can solve that then it helps with a lot of things.\n\nMaybe I didn't understand the question - maybe it supposed to be some idiosyncratic thing that bothers me....",
      "Correct!",
      "Polio eradication is a big focus for me. Our last case in Africa was 6 months ago and we are hoping no more show up. It takes over a year to be sure. We still have cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Until we get rid of it there it can spread back to other countries. Pakistan is starting to take this seriously including the army and the government. They need to do the same things that were done in Nigeria. The Taliban makes it very difficult. They have killed women going to vaccinate kids many times.\n\n",
      "This is a complex issue. Privacy will be increasingly important as cameras and GPS sensors are gathering information to try and be helpful. We need to have trust in the way information is protected and gathered. There is a role for the government to try and stop crime and terrorism but it will have to be more open. I do think terrorism with biological or nuclear weapons is something we want to minimize the chance of.",
      "The ultimate is computers that learn. So called deep learning which started at Microsoft and is now being used by many researchers looks like a real advance that may finally learn. It has already made a big difference in video and audio recognition - more progress in the last 3 years than ever before.",
      "He and I respected each other. Our biggest joint project was the Mac where Microsoft had more people on the project than Apple did as we wrote a lot of applications. I saw Steve regularly over the years including spending an afternoon with him a few months before he tragically passed away...",
      "20 years ago I would stay in the office for days at a time and not think twice about it - so I had energy and naivete on my side. Now hopefully I am a bit more mellow but with a little extra wisdom.",
      "No I cannot. I can still jump but not over a full sized garbage can like I used to be able to. Be careful - it can hurt if you don't succeed.",
      "I have enjoyed meeting other philanthropists and talking about what they work on. I think there is a movement to do more, start sooner and be smarter about giving. Philanthropy is mostly about a broad set of people giving but it helps if the most wealthy set a strong example...",
      "Playing Bridge is a pretty old fashioned thing in a way that I really like. I was watching my daughter ride horses this weekend and that is also a bit old fashioned but fun. I do the dishes every night - other people volunteer but I like the way I do it.",
      "I recently saw a company working on \"robotic\" surgery where the ability to work at small scales was stunning. The idea that this will make surgeries higher quality, faster and less expensive is pretty exciting. It will probably take a decade before this gets mainstream - to date it has mostly been used for prostate surgery.\n\nIn the Foundation work there are a lot of tools we are working on we don't have yet. For example an implant to protect a woman from getting HIV because it releases a protective drug. ",
      "I definitely think leaving kids massive amounts of money is not a favor to them. Warren Buffett was part of an article in Fortune talking about this in 1986 before I met him and it made me think about it and decide he was right. Some people disagree with this but Melinda and I feel good about it.",
      "I agree that our schools have not improved as much as we want them to. There are a lot of great teachers but we don't do enough to figure out what they do so well and make sure others benefit from that. Most teachers get very little feedback about what they do well and what they need to improve including tools that let them see what the exemplars are doing.\n\nTechnology is starting to improve education. Unfortunately so far it is mostly the motivated students who have benefited from it. I think we will get tools like personalized learning to all students in the next decade. \n\nA lot of the issue is helping kids stay engaged. If they don't feel the material is relevant or they don't have a sense of their own ability they can check out too easily. The technology has not done enough to help with this yet.",
      "Politics operates in 4 years cycles and climate change is a challenge that needs decades of work to reduce green house gas emission. I am disappointed that the US is where the debate has been the most difficult. November in Paris was a positive milestone with a commitment to reductions and a commitment to innovation by the [governments](http://mission-innovation.net/) and [private sector](http://www.breakthroughenergycoalition.com/en/index.html).",
      "We’ve seen an amazing drop in child mortality since 2000—most of them in that red box. [The Global Goals]( http://www.gatesnotes.com/Development/UNGA-2015-Setting-Global-Goals?WT.mc_id=09_17_2015_IHMEpost_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE) being adopted by the U.N. this month are aimed in part at shrinking it even more.",
      "Microsoft and others are working on quantum computing. It isn't clear when it will work or become mainstream. There is a chance that within 6-10 years that cloud computing will offer super-computation by using quantum. It could help use solve some very important science problems including materials and catalyst design.",
      "Each corporation has to look at what capabilities it has and how it can use those to help people in need whether it is research or tiered pricing or having employees volunteer. When I was in Scotland I met with people at an NHS hospital there who had paired with a hospital in Zambia and it was amazing how much they helped save lives by visiting and supporting their colleagues. I think creative things like this where individuals get involved can make a big difference both locally and internationally.\n",
      "We had a rich database as the client/cloud store that was part of a Windows release that was before its time. This is an idea that will remerge since your cloud store will be rich with schema rather than just a bunch of files and the client will be a partial replica of it with rich schema understanding. ",
      "Polio is the first thing to get done since we are close. Within 6 years we will have the last case. After that we will go after malaria and measles. Malaria kills over 500,000 kids every year mostly in Africa and did not get enough attention until the last decade. We also need vaccines to prevent HIV and TB which are making progress...",
      "I just went on a trip with my 17 year old son to see 6 colleges. He is a junior in High School and trying to figure out where he should go. Trips like that have been a great way to spend time together. He reads even more about politics than I do so I let him pick books for me to read.\n\nMelinda is very creative about helping me find chances to spend time with the kids. Even just driving them to school is a great time to talk to them.\n\n",
      "Malaria is a super important area for the Foundation. The number of deaths has been cut in half using bed nets and spraying and new drugs. For the future we need new tools since resistance is developing to all the current tools. We don't have a vaccine that protects for long enough to help out yet but we are investing heavily in one. We do a lot of modelling to understand which tools would help the most. One that would be new is called gene drive which would reduce mosquito populations for a number of years to make it easier to clear the malaria from all of the humans - this will be ready for field testing in a few years",
      "So far our biggest impact has been getting vaccines for things like diarrhea and pneumonia out which has saved millions of lives. Polio will be a great achievement along with key partners when that gets done.",
      "Robots, pervasive screens, speech interaction will all change the way we look at \"computers\". Once seeing, hearing, and reading (including handwriting) work very well you will interact in new ways..",
      "Seriously Bing is the better product at this point. Try the challenge. I am biased but the work to make Bing better has been amazing.",
      "Yes. A small enough chair I can still jump over.",
      "No I don't. Other people think about that but I wouldn't want to extend my last few years unless that is happening for most people.",
      "Hopefully we won't have terrorists using nuclear weapons or biological weapons. We should make sure that stays hard.\n\nI am disappointed more isn't being done to reduce carbon emissions. Governments need to spend more on basic energy R&D to make sure we get cheap non-CO2 emitting sources as soon as possible.\n\nOverall I am pretty optimistic. Things are a lot better than they were 200 years ago..",
      "This is an easy question. I am good friends with Paul Allen who owns the Seahawks and I live in Seattle. The playoff game was amazing to watch. Go Seahawks!",
      "There are two things this could reference. One is the free/pay for software mix. The Internet has benefited from having lots of free stuff and lots of commercial software. It has been interesting see people inventing hybrid models. Even stuff that is pretty commercial often has free versions for some audiences.  Even the most open stuff often have services people choose to pay for.\n\nThe second thing is the anonymous versus identified tension. This is another one where both will probably thrive since you want anonymity for some things and full identity for others. I am surprised how little progress has been made in the identity space but it will improve.\n\n",
      "The violence against the vaccinators in both Pakistan and Nigeria is a terrible thing. However both countries are committed to finishing the eradication. This is the project I spent most of my time on. We should be able to finish by 2018 although that will require raising funds and some great execution. We have some innovations like the way we use satellite maps to find all the villages and GPS tracking to make sure the teams go to every hut that are helping out. Polio is a harder disease than smallpox was but it is doable. (I discuss this more at www.billsletter.com and you can learn more about the progress against polio with this infographic: http://annualletter.gatesfoundation.org/#nav=section4&slide=2)",
      "I think the value of getting a great education - that is going to college - is easy to underestimate. The most interesting jobs require a college education. The STEM related jobs are probably the most interesting although they are not for everyone. The value of staying curious - reading a lot and learning new things even after college is also underestimated.",
      "Over time countries will be rich enough to do this. However we still have a lot of work that should be done - helping older people, helping kids with special needs, having more adults helping in education. Even the US isn't rich enough to allow people not to work. Some day we will be but until then things like the Earned Income Tax Credit will help increase the demand for labor.",
      "Yes. It is hard to say when but this is a certainty. Fortunately we got through that one reasonably well. Warren has talked about this and he understands this area far better than I do.\n\nDespite this prediction of bumps ahead I am quite optimistic about how innovation and capitalism will improve the situation for humans everywhere.",
      "The Capitol Steps albums do this trick of switching first letters and it is very cool.",
      "Education would be the top issue since it is key to individual opportunity and to the country as a whole and we are not doing as well as other countries. After that I would say immigration since the injustice of the current system is incredible.",
      "I think you did - sorry I can't deliver an Empire (or an Age) easily.",
      "Vaccines are very important in all countries. Some of the bad rumors have lead to kids dying of measles and pertussis. We have backed some information campaigns on the importance of vaccination even in the US.\n\nThe Nordic countries do a good job on health like they do on many things...",

Maybe medicine or theoretical math but it is hard to say.\n\nMost giving is done by the middle class so it is the backbone of generosity particularly in the United States.

      "Yes - essentially most resources don't get \"destroyed\". The elements that were here to begin with are still here. Of course it takes energy to recycle things but I am optimistic we will figure out how to avoid destroying the planet. The number of babies born has already peaked which will help limit the maximum population size.",
      "It is worth learning how to read a bit faster. I am not sure what the best course for that is nowadays. I had a friend who took Evelyn Wood and told me what they said.\n\nI have a rule that I always finish a book once I start it. This might now work for everyone. I only read 2 books at a time - in fact usually just one unless one of them is so complex I need to mix things up. I read a lot at night and my biggest problem is that I stay up to late and regret it the next day when I haven't had as much sleep as I would like.",
      "A lot of our failures have been backing science that didn't work out. One thing that is tough is when you think the government will take over something you start but they don't - we had that with a school lunch program. It might have been better if we hadn't done it.",

I was thrilled Satya asked me to pitch in to make sure Microsoft is ambitious with its innovation. Even in Office there is a lot more than can be done.",
      "I never went for a big salary but your basic point is correct.",
      "Our goals are focused on helping the poorest (globally) and improving education (in the US). We spend half of our money on global health. One metric to look at is reducing the number of children (under 5) who die. My annual letter talks about the amazing progress that has been made on this.  Amazingly as health improves families choose to have less kids so paradoxically population growth goes DOWN as you improve health helping with almost every issue - from stability to the environment..\n\nThe Rosling video I posted on Sunday talks about this: http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/189bwr/most_people_still_think_of_the_world_as_being/",
      "Sewage is a problem. Since it costs money to process it just gets dumped in slums in poor countries. The system the rich world uses of pumping in clean water and pumping it to a processing plant is too expensive. I challenged engineers to create a processor of sewage where the costs could be covered by the energy and water (clean water) that it outputs. We have made progress on that. One team, Janicki, which was written up in Wired, is send a prototype machine to Senegal later this year. Getting rid of sewage helps a lot to reduce disease and improve living conditions.\n&nbsp;\n\n**EDIT:** Speaking of the OmniProcessor. You inspired me to post a photo over in /r/photoshopbattles.

It doesn't use Thorium - it uses the 97% of Uranium that normally can't be used for a reactor by breeding and burning. This means fuel will always be cheap. There are a lot of innovations but the key one is that it is far far safer than anything today - not relying on human operators.",
      "Fortunately as people get healthy they choose to have less kids. We have already had the maximum number of births - that number is starting to go down.

      "In normal reproduction, a mosquito carrying an altered gene passes it on to 50 percent of its offspring. Last year researchers showed that you can pass the gene for females to produce mostly sterile males down to 99 percent of the offspring of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. But this research is still at a very early stage. Nothing is ready to be deployed yet. More work needs to be done to figure out whether mosquitoes will develop resistance to the gene and we need to ensure that any gene-edited mosquito is ultimately safe to release.\n \nYou’re right that many species of mosquito are capable of transmitting malaria. But if we focus on a few species responsible for most of the infections, we have a good chance of knocking down transmission rates to the point where we could wipe out the remaining malaria parasites with a combination of insecticides, surveillance, and treatment.  We’re investing in a lot of different approaches—including a next-generation malaria vaccine—because experience has shown the best way to fight malaria is with a combination of tools. \n\nIn regard to the overall challenge of mosquito-borne disease, I think that outbreaks of Zika and other viruses are a powerful reminder that mosquitoes don’t recognize borders. That’s why the National Institutes of Health and other government agencies are investing in mosquito control efforts for both Aedes aegypti (the mosquito primarily responsible for Zika, dengue, and Chikungunya) and malaria. They’re tremendous partners in these efforts.",
      "“[Factfulness](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Factfulness?WT.mc_id=05_24_2018_4_Factfulness_BG-RE_&WT.tsrc=BGRE)” is a worldview that will help you see the world more clearly.

      "Actually Smil isn’t a Malthusian and neither am I. Malthusians make the mistake of underestimating the impact that innovation will have in raising crop productivity and other improvements. One example that Smil cites: roughly 12 percent of the Earth’s ice-free land is devoted to farmland, but the number would be close to 50 percent if it weren’t for innovations in agriculture since 1900… \n\nMarkets can drive a lot of these innovations, but they don’t work well for the poorest, who can’t afford to pay for the innovations. In those cases, philanthropy and rich country governments can step in to create incentives for private companies to work on those problems, whether it’s developing new seeds or vaccines for diseases that disproportionately affect the poor.\n",
      "You raise good questions about meat consumption, but I see it slightly differently. Incomes will continue to rise over the coming years, especially in middle-income countries, which means that more people will be able to afford more meat. In fact global demand for meat is likely to double between 2000 and 2030. It’s good news that people’s incomes will go up. But producing meat takes a lot of land and water and also increases emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. So we need more ways to satisfy the growing demand for meat without depleting our resources or worsening climate change. That’s why I’m interested in companies that are finding innovative ways to turn plants into foods that look and taste just like real meat and eggs. ICYMI, my review links to a neat feature about some of this work (http://www.thegatesnotes.com/features/future-of-food).",

I wish more people knew about him...\n\nI agree that looking at big systems is crucial. If you want to understand something as complex as humans’ impact on the biosphere, you have to look at a huge range of factors. Smil does that better than just about anyone else.\n\nIn Harvesting the Biosphere he has a bulleted list of recommendations that range from cutting food waste to promoting best practices in agriculture (optimal fertilization, crop rotation, etc.). But like most scientists he is more interested in understanding and explaining the facts than in making predictions or policy recommendations.

If these players don't raise $16,000 to get safer helmets and new equipment (their equipment now is over a decade old), the Inner City Urban Development (ICUD) league in Des Moines won't be able to continue helping these kids. The ICUD has provided a safe and positive environment for youth to learn essential life skills to become better individuals both on and off the field. With your support, we can ensure this amazing youth football program continues. \n\nhttp://www.kcci.com/news/youth-football-league-needs-new-equipment/27891710\n\nOver 10 years ago, I started the Snoop Youth Football League (SYFL) in LA. My commitment to youth football programs is a cause that is close to my heart and I'm looking to you to help support these kids. Together, we can help fund this League that teaches our youth the most important life skills: dedication, teamwork, and sportsmanship.\n\nHelp me help these kids!!\n",

      "Excellent question.  We think life is alive and a slap of iron is not because, among a few other reasons, we have metabolism.  We consume energy in the service of our existence.  If we find any other entity that does this too, it would make a good candidate for life.  Consider also that you reference and \"unearthly\" element.  That is not likely at all because the periodic table of elements is full. There's no room for any other elements to be discovered in the natural universe.  And using spectroscopy, we confirm that these very same elements are found in stars across the universe itself.  Not only that, the four most common chemically active ingredients in the universe (H, He, O, C, N) are the SAME four most abundant ingredients in life on Earth.  So our bias in searching for \"life as we know it\" is not entirely close-minded.  -NDTyson",
      "I may be partly guilty for your scientific angst.  Most of my public science persona involves conveying the joy of scientific discovery, and especially the joy of curiosity, from childhood through adulthood.  What's commonly absent from my messaging is the steep investment of time and energy (physical and emotional) that becoming a scientist and actually doing science requires.  In fact the struggle **is** what must be loved by aspiring scientists because being a practicing scientist requires this of you daily.\n\nNot knowing the answer to a problem and struggling to find the answer is precisely what science is.  It's neither more nor less than this.

      "Lately I've had about one such incident per week. Although my target is one per day.  I recently learned from some dynamicist colleagues that the striking visibility of Saturn's ring system is not eternal, coming and going with the dynamical forces of all that orbits the planet.  Which means if I were around back when the Dinosaurs roamed and showed them Saturn through a telescope, it might have been an uninteresting sight.  Very sad.  -NDTyson",
      "Wolf in sheep's clothes.  My read of the (entire) plan is to remove Earth monitoring from NASA's mission statement.  leaving NASA to think only about the rest of the Universe and not Earth as a part of that same universe. Unless this task is picked up by some other agency, the disconnect will be disastrous to our understanding of our own planet, preventing us from knowing and predicting our own impact on our own environment.  My sense is that the next generation (30 and younger) does not think this way.  They just don't happen to be old enough to be head of agency, corporations, or government yet. So I look forward to when they are all in charge.  Especially anyone born since 1995 -- the year we discovered our first exoplanet.  For that reason, I dub that demographic \"Generation Exoplanet\".  -NDTyson",

Innovations in science and technology are the engines of tomorrow health, wealth, and security.  So any school district that eschews the discoveries of science has disenfranchised itself from the future of civilization.

And it's those headlines that trigger change more than any other force.\n\nPeople praised Mayor Bloomberg for allowing the protesters to stay on location.  But it was not his authority to grant or deny.  The right to protest for grievances with the government to be redressed is fundamental to what it is to be American -- a nation founded on the need to protest the abuses of government.\n\nIn a free market economy you can't dictate the salaries of what a board chooses to compensate its executives. We have all bought into the capitalist system of our nation.  Outlawing the fact that some people get too much money would be like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.  But what one can do is draft a manifesto that offers guidelines for what is a sensible distribution of compensation in a company -- for example, setting a maximum ratio of salaries between the highest compensated person and the lowest.  Companies that comply would then get listed as best for its workers.  This would put social pressure on the system, in much the same way the Green Moment has put social pressure on companies to conduct business with greater respect for the environment.

      "Wow.\n\nThat's a big question, okay?\n\nI've actually though quite a bit about this.\n\nI don't know if I can answer succinctly. But wouldn't it be impressive if I answered in less time than it took you to ask this question.\n\nWe've all heard of STEM, and it's gaining funding streams, attracting students into science programs - and that exists because *any* measure we can take of growth of economies traces to the roles of science and technology. It's the reality of things. We've known this since the Industrial Reveolution and beyond.\n\nWhat the Arts community has noticed is - why don't we *ride* that movement? And maybe stick an A in that STEM, and make it STEAM?\n\nAnd I think that's clever, and I don't have a problem with that. But be careful with what you're after. Because if you're going to assert that by training people in art, you will drive the economy in the same way you would with STEM - i don't see that happening. In fact, the great ways that art has driven the economy is when it's touched with technology. Look at cinema - technology adapted to create films. Green screen, the Steadicam, the roles that computers have played in generating cinema - I'm talking about kinds of art that is economically stable as a field, as opposed to art that requires charitable donations to sustain.\n\nSo when art DOES move the economy, it's generally because there's some form of technology that has touched it.\n\nBut another way to be honest with ourselves is to say that whether or not art moves the economy, art is something that humans have done as a species. And the great cities of Europe are remembered because of the great art they have fostered. When you go to Florence, you don't go there to drink the water. Art has value to us *culturally* whether or not you're going to assert it drives an economic sector.\n\nYou could make a country with *no* art - but is that a country you want to live in?\n\nYou can create a country without art. But who would live there? \n\nNot I! \n\nSo maybe the case for art should really be - *we should do this because we can.* We should do this because the greatest works of art are cherished over the centuries and over the millennia. If that's not reason enough - *change* who represents you in Congress. ",

That captures the height of our artistic expression, triggered by religious emotion. And religion is a big part of what civilization has been. The Rothko Chapel is a path to your inner solitude.\n\nAnd the fact that art can *get you there* - in a space, I think - matters.\n\nAnd I would say third, again it's a space - the Waterlily Room, in Paris, where you have the Waterlilies, where as Impressionist Art, you don't *think* Waterlilies by seeing the artwork, you *feel* them.

If more people knew that, perhaps they'd be flocking to the physics classes rather than shunning them.",

I've said many time and many places, e.g. http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/buy/books/space-chronicles that projects that are hugely expensive and dangerous, with uncertain returns on investments make poor activities of profit-driven companies.

      "*chuckles heartily*\n\nUh...if I were painted nude... First, I think, the nude human body is highly overrated, hahaha! In college I was in an art survey class, and one of the units was we were drawing nudes, drawing models - you pay just to look at them, for models, which is an extraordinary fact that such a profession exists in our culture. But the people who came into the room were just people. And you realize that most people don't have bodies that you would pay to look at, haha! You'd hold out something, saying \"Hold this!\"\n\nI'm just being candid about my first thoughts, about when these people walked in for us to draw them.\n\nAnyhow, if I had to pick a planetary surface, why not... Mars.\n\nI think the surface of Mars is rust-colored, it's red, it has a reddish hue in the background, and I think there's a reddish hue in my skin, so maybe they'd compliment one another. But I'd have to take breaths every once in a while, so we'd have to rig up a breathing apparatus while I'm posing.\n\nSo I'd say Mars.\n\nBy the way, on Venus, the surface is 900 degrees Fahrenheit. So I'd vaporize.\n\nSo MAYBE that's influencing my decision.\n\nBut it is true that Mars is red because of rusty iron, which is throughout the rocks and geology of the surface. Which is why the Romans named the planet after their God of War, because of the color of blood.\n\nAnd if our hemoglobin were based on copper instead of iron, then our blood would be green - and then we would have never named Mars after the god of War. We might have named Earth after the god of war, with all its greenery. And then what color would they make stoplights?\n\nHmmm.\n\nThat's for you to contemplate.\n\nNext question!",

      "As you know, I study astrophysics, and let me tell you the kind of art I'm *least* interested in - it's when people see these beautiful images from the Hubble telescope, and they're inspired by that, and they just sort of draw that.\n\nAnd my response is - I don't NEED you to draw that. I have the telescope to give me that. As an artist, why don't you process that through your own creativity, and take me to a place I've never been before?\n\nThen you're *adding* a dimension to it. Don't just copy what's there - I'm not telling an artist what to do, but what I *like* is when an artist is inspired by the Universe, and it goes through their machine, and comes out of them in a new kind of way, and you go \"*Hey...I bet i know what inspired that.\"*\n\nI want an artist to show me something I might not have noticed about that natural beauty. I want an artist to layer an emotion on that natural beauty that I might not have seen myself, or even known to access. So that's how I - I have an artwork in my office, forgive me, I don't remember who painted it and I'm embarrassed by that - I'll take a camera to my office- they made me come to reddit's office, I'm sorry - but in my office I could have reached for stuff - it's their fault - ANYWAYS, it is the launchpad of the Saturn V rocket. I don't need an artist to draw that. Because i see and feel the energy of it in photos and video.\n\nBut *AH!* - it's not an exact replica of the photo. It's what the launch FEELS like.\n\nThat's why I have it on the wall.\n\nThat's why I want an artist to do for me.\n\nAnd medium? I like sculptures, and I like paintings.\n\nPainting because we have 2-dimensional walls in our offices, and homes. It's a convenient medium on which to put that kind of art.\n\nAnd in a way, we all embrace art that moves through the time dimension, because those are movies, and who doesn't love sitting on the couch and watching a movie? But you have to commit time to that, which doesn't fit as nicely into people's lives, where you can walk by a painting and reflect on it as you continue walking.\n\nI happen to like paintings that are textured in some way. I'm a big fan of Van Gogh, for that reason. So in a way - the texture of the paint is a dimension of how the information is being communicated to me. So I *value* that.\n\nShadows will change, depending on the lighting. I value that as well.\n\nAnd I like sculpture. Particularly of people. Rodin. You know, I tried to pose the way Rodin did, and it's essentially impossible - well, you can pose like THE THINKER if you're really skinny and don't have a lot of muscle mass.\n\nBut the person portrayed - the hand on the forehead - ***over and down*** - any guy out there, go and try and do that if you have some muscles in your body - ***UGH NO*** - If I'm doing this, I'm in pain, I'm not thinking about anything else but undoing that position.\n\nBut he makes it look so natural! That's what's fascinating about it!\n\nAnd THE KISS! I was with my daughter in Paris, who had an internet boyfriend for like 9 months - and they Skyped - so I met him for the first time, we're touring around, and we come to Rodin's THE KISS, so I had them sit in the same format as THE KISS, and it's also a little bit odd.\n\nThe guy's hand, that comes around - it has to be like, a foot longer than your *actual* arm would have to be to embrace her in that way. \n\nBut I like thinking about sculptures of people. And what form they take.\n\nSo, yeah.\n\nI was never into mobiles. Like...why?\n\nFor no deep reason, I just never related to them. ",

I recently came across a book of his that was filled with accounts of experiments he conducted, which may have informed his important philosophical conclusions about the value of experiment in finding scientific truths. This was around the same time as Galileo, who arrived at the same conclusions.  Of course back then, \"Natural Philosophy\" was practically synonymous with what today we call Physics.\n\nIn the 20th centruy, when the atom revealed itself to our experiments, and the expanding universe entered our largest telescopes, it made philosophizing about the natural world harder than before, where now, what's true no longer issues forth from our senses.\n\nExperiments matter.   And if you do experiments, we generally call you a scientist and not a philosopher.\n\nPlenty of philosophy frontiers abound, including Moral & Ethical Philosophy, Political Philosophy, Religious Philosophy.

That'd be interesting. Very temporary. Just like flowers. Combining nature with your artistic expression. Then you'd get to do a little biology there with your art.

      "Not an art question, but I'm happy to field it.  \"Belief\"  as we currently use the term in  society, almost always refers to confidence in a truth in the absence of evidence.  For if there were reliable evidence then presumably you would instead use the word \"knowledge\".   What's behind this is the notion of objective truths.  These are truths that can be established outside of your personal sensory perceptions. (The methods and tools of science are invented to enhance or replace the limited biological senses we're born with.)  If you cannot establish the truth of something outside of your own mind, then you hold what's called a personal truth. I rarely express public opinions, but one of them is that personal truths have no place in democratic governance.  Laws and legislation that apply to everyone need to be based in objective truths for them to have meaning to us all.  And evidence matters in establishing objective truths.  So personally, I guess my answer is no, I carry no assertions of truth for which there is no evidence to support it.  I may have a hypothesis that I'm testing.  But my confidence in it's truth will always be in proportion to the quality and quantity of evidence available to me.  -NDTyson",

      "Yes. But nothing deep. I occasionally thing about what art portrays culturally and scientifically.  In the Louvre, you have Leonardo's \"Mona Lisa\".  And around the corner, down the hall, there's a painting by Marie-Guillemine Benoist named simply \"Portrait of a Negress\".  I'm intrigued that, unlike the Mona Lisa, the black woman's name is not part of the painting's title.  I also note that most moons painted are either full or crescent.  Other moon shapes -- especially gibbous, that phase between half and full moon -- appear to be less aesthetically pleasing to the artist.  So I actually get excited when I find an illustrated moon in its gibbous phase.  One other thing I look for is which arm of Madonna is holding the baby Jesus. For most (> 90%) paintings I've seen across Europe, it's the left arm.  Since most people are right-handed, this makes sense, freeing the right hand for anything else.  But also, the human heart is loudest on the left side of your chest, and this sound is soothing to an infant.  So for any model sitting for the portrait, posing with an actual child, the child will more likely be calmer on the left side of her body.  So that makes sense too.  But in a recent trip to Venice, Italy -- my first time there -- a stunningly high percent of Madonna paintings portrayed the baby Jesus in her right arm.  I don't have an exact fraction, but it may be as high as 40%. This shocked me and I have no understanding of it.  -NDTyson",

Most of the wispy nebulosities are so dim, they're simply invisible to the human eye.  Not only that, Hubble sees in the IR and UV.  Two completely invisible band of light to the Human retina.  So the best way to answer your question is, 1) if your eyes were as big a Hubble's mirror, 2) if you could see IR and UV, 3) if you were above the blurring effects of Earth's atmosphere, 4) if the color sensitive cones in the human retina were not sensitive only to Red Green and Blue, but could shift for each image to where the most interesting light was coming from, then yes, you would see the Hubble images just as they have been presented to you.\n-NDTyson",
      "In my youth I had quite a literal mind.  So metaphor and symbolism would often go unnoticed.  And so for the longest time, a painting to me was always something less than what a photograph would capture. The big transition for me was freshman year of college, after I took a studio art survey class.  This sensitized me to where and how an artist can take you to places you've never been before.  Afterwards, my first memory of artwork that left me reflecting on its form and substance was the paintings of Frederick Lord Leighton. They reached in me and communicated a kind of magical realism that transcended anything a representative photograph would ever capture.  I was transported, not to a reality but to a hyper-reality.  This opened my eyes to the rest of the art universe, exploring what alternative realities I had been missing.  -NDTyson",

That's not my doing, it's the doing of those who have decided to cherrypick science in ways that support, or do not conflict, with their personal belief systems, be they cultural, political, religious, or economic.).

So if a Picasso painting of a particular style goes for huge sums of money, then what typically happens is that all Picasso painting in that style get a boost, whether or not they are in private hands.  I'm not judging whether this is good or bad, just citing that in a free market, this is normal and expected.  It happens with wine and antiquarian books and almost anything that is desired, but rare or singular in the world.  But are most of the greatest works of art in the world actually in private hands.  I wouldn't think so.  But what happens often is a Museum Curator wants to do a retrospective, and needs works of art not entirely in the Museum's collection.  So they obtain artwork on loan from rich people.  And the rich people get a recognized in the exhibit for this magnanimity.   And often a substitute painting is offered back to the loaner so they don't have to look at an empty wall in their mansion.  This system seems to work well.  But I'm left wondering if there's any painting that experts judge to be important but never, ever, gets out of private hands.

      "Try as I have to see this differently, the streets that connect Art and science are generally not two-ways.  Science (and especially technology) definitely affects Art -- primarily via the methods and tools and creative media of the artist.  For an obvious example, look at how many CGI people are employed for every blockbuster film produced. And before photography, every naturalist employed an artist to capture nature in enough detail to study the form and substance of the object being studied.  But today I don't see wholesale scientific ideas or discoveries influenced by artists.

Well, we'll see. \n\nRegarding nuclear power, the biggest problem the industry has is that no one wants a nuclear plant around-- in their neighborhood. As a result, it takes 15 or 20 years to get a plant licensed. The Solutions Project people point out that it's a long time, time that we probably don't have. The nuclear power plants in France, by way of example are going on 40-years old. Will they continue to operate reliably? Or, will they start to show signs of wearing out? Will their licenses be renewed? We'll see. Keep in mind also, France's economy is smaller than California's. I believe the Solutions Project is imagining changes on a larger scale.

We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.",
      "Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.",

Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you.  The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014.

      "I understand how tough it is out there for recent grads. You're right -\nyour long term prospects are great, but that doesn't help in the short\nterm. Obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young\npeople at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill,\nyou can stay on your parent's plan until you're twenty six. Because of\nour student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young\npeople have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that's why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don't be discouraged - we didn't get into this fix overnight, and we won't get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more.",

      "The answer is that everything depends upon the kind of strong grassroots movement that we can develop. If we do not have tens of millions of people actively involved in the political process, there is very little that any president can do because of the power of big money over the political and economic process. So what I have said time and time again is that we need a political revolution in this country, which means that 80 percent. of the people vote, not 40 percent, and which means that people demand that Congress represent the middle class and working families of this country and not just the billionaire class.",
      "The major issue in terms of our electoral system is truly campaign finance reform. Right now, we are at a moment in history where the Koch brothers and other billionaires are in the process of buying politicians and elections. We need to overturn Citizens United with a constitutional amendment. We need to pass disclosure legislation. We need to move toward public funding of elections. We also have got to see an increased federal role in the outrageous gerrymandering that Republican states have created and in voter suppression. These are the main issues that I'll be tackling in the coming months.",
      "My first effort would be to rally the American people to demand that Congress pass a progressive agenda which reverses the decline of our middle class. We have got to create millions of decent-paying jobs rebuilding our infrastructure, we've got to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, we've got to overturn this disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court decision and we have to transform our energy system in order to protect us from climate change. If the American people are politically active and demand that Congress act on their behalf, we can accomplish those goals and much more.",
      "1. Thank you for the good question. I believe I have been consistent throughout my political life in terms of my basic values and what I stand for. Obviously, when you are a United States senator working in a conservative environment, you often have to do the best that you can within the circumstances that you find yourself. Two particular examples: last year, I helped write the most comprehensive veterans legislation passed in many years. Trust me, I had to change my position on very important aspects of veterans' health care in order to get it passed. In terms of health care, I am an advocate of a Medicare-for-all single-payer program. I voted for the Affordable Care Act, not because I think it is the end place as to where we should be, but because I was able to get a major provision in it that greatly expanded primary health care -- which is helping many millions of people today. So the bottom line is that you have to stick by your values but when you're in an elected position, especially when you're in a conservative Congress, now and then you're going to have to compromise.\n\n2. Great question. And let me repeat what I have said many times. The only way we deal with the major issues facing our country -- raising the minimum wage to a living wage, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, addressing climate change in a bold way, overturning Citizens United, demanding that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, making college affordable for all, etc. -- is when ordinary people put massive pressure on the Congress. Right now, the Congressional leadership represents the interests of the wealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations. Instead of raising the minimum wage, they're giving tax breaks to billionaires and cutting nutrition programs. Nothing will change unless millions of people demand it and that's what this campaign is all about -- mobilizing people at the grassroots level.",
      "Thank you. I believe that the TPP is a disastrous agreement and I am working as hard as I can to see it defeated. One of the reasons that the middle class of this country is disappearing is because we have lost some 60,000 factories since 2001 and millions of good-paying manufacturing jobs. We need trade agreements that protect and benefit working families, not just the CEOs of large corporations.\n\nIn terms of getting the attention of elected officials, writing letters and emails as well as phoning is very important. But, what is even more important is grassroots organizing. Putting together a meeting of 100 people about an issue and inviting that elected official to that meeting to hear comments would be a huge step forward in making politicians aware that you know what's going on and that you want your concerns addressed. I have done hundreds of town meetings as an elected official and urge citizens to organize them as fast as they can.",
      "I respectfully disagree. It is not my view, nor have I suggested, that GMO food causes health problems. What I have said is that the people of our country, as well as people around the world, have the right to make choices in terms of what they eat and have the right to have labels telling them whether or not food is made with GMOs. As you know, GMO labeling exists in dozens of countries and the state legislature in Vermont also passed a bill requiring that. I support that effort.",
      "Great question. Our legislation not only would make tuition free at public colleges and universities, it would also cut student debt in half. It is absurd that millions of college graduates today are carrying debts of $50,000, $60,000, $100,000 or more. Our legislation deals with the issue of student debt in a very significant way.",
      "So long as you have Republicans in control of the House and the Senate, and so long as you have a Congress dominated by big money, I can guarantee you that the discussion about universal basic income is going to go nowhere in a hurry. But, if we can develop a strong grassroots movement which says that every man, woman and child in this country is entitled to a minimum standard of living -- is entitled to health care, is entitled to education, is entitled to housing -- then we can succeed. We are living in the richest country in the history of the world, yet we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country and millions of people are struggling to put food on the table. It is my absolute conviction that everyone in this country deserves a minimum standard of living and we've got to go forward in the fight to make that happen.",
      "Thank you very much for your support. And we look forward to your ideas as to how we can run the most effective grassroots campaign possible. Certainly one of the areas that redditors can help on is in making sure that young people throughout this country understand the importance of politics and government. It is an American tragedy that in the last election, about 80 percent of young people did not vote. That is exactly what the ruling class of this country wants and we have got to change it. So mobilizing, educating and organizing young people is very much at the top of my agenda.",
      "I believe that climate change is perhaps the most significant planetary crisis that we face and we have got to be extremely bold in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels and towards energy efficiency and sustainability. The fact is that investing in solar, wind, geothermal and energy efficiency is far more cost-effective than nuclear plants. Further, I do not support more nuclear power plants when we do not know how we get rid of the toxic waste from the ones that already exist.",
      "Let me just say this -- the state of Vermont voted to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana and I support that. I have supported the use of medical marijuana.

Our police had more important things to do.\n\nColorado has led the effort toward legalizing marijuana and I'm going to watch very closely to see the pluses and minuses of what they have done. I will have more to say about this issue within the coming months.",
      "1. Well, that is a very big hypothetical. Yes I do believe that there can be just wars. But, you are talking to somebody who opposed Vietnam, who voted against the first Gulf War, who voted against the War in Iraq and who believes the United States has been far far too aggressive militarily in the last many years. We have got to work with the international community not only in trying to create peaceful resolutions to conflict, but to address the underlying causes of war. This is not easy stuff. But that is the direction in which we have to move.",
      "Excellent questions. You are right. People in general and young people in particular are increasingly alienated and disillusioned with the political process. The middle class is disappearing, the rich get richer, young people cannot afford college, the crisis of climate change is ignored, and Congress continues on its merry way paying attention to the needs of billionaires and multinational corporations. The truth is that we are in a very difficult political moment. But despair of giving up is just not an option. I would not be doing what I am doing if I did not believe that this country could provide health care to all as a right; that we could lead the world in transforming our energy system and dealing with climate change; that we could make education affordable for all. My strong belief is that it is imperative that we maintain our vision of what American can be, and that we fight hard to make that happen. DO NOT GIVE UP.",
      "I voted against the war in Iraq and I voted against the first Gulf War. I am strongly opposed to sending American combat troops into Iraq and Syria. At the end of the day, the war against ISIS will only be won when the Muslim countries in the area fully engage and defeat ISIS and other groups that are distorting what Islam is supposed to be about. The United States and other western countries should be supportive of the efforts of those governments, but cannot lead them. The nightmare, which I believe a number of Republicans want to see, is perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East.",
      "Very important question. There is no question but that automation and robotics reduce the number of workers needed to produce products. On the other hand, there is a massive amount of work that needs to be done in this country. Our infrastructure is crumbling and we can create millions of decent-paying jobs rebuilding our roads, bridges, rail system, airports, levees, dams, etc. Further, we have enormous shortages in terms of highly-qualified pre-school educators and teachers. We need more doctors, nurses, dentists and medical personnel if we are going to provide high-quality care to all of our people. But, in direct response to the question, increased productivity should not punish the average worker, which is why we have to move toward universal health care, making higher education available to all, a social safety net which is strong and a tax system which is progressive.",
      "As the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, I share your concern very deeply. The recently-passed Republican budget makes massive cuts in almost every governmental agency, including those engaged in our scientific research. This is a disaster. If we are going to address the major health issues facing our society -- Alzheimer's, diabetes, cancer, etc. -- we need to invest more in research and develop the best research centers in the world.",
      "As somebody who has consistently voted to end discrimination in all forms -- who voted against DOMA way back in the 1990s -- I will do all that I can to continue our efforts to make this a nondiscriminatory society, whether those being discriminated against are transgender, gay, black or Hispanic.",
      "Help us educate and organize and spread the message of what this campaign is about. If every American understood that 99 percent of all new income generated in this county today goes to the top 1 percent, and that the top one-tenth of 1 percent owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, millions of people would join us in fighting for a political revolution so that Washington represents all of us, not just wealthy campaign contributors. So, as this campaign evolves, we are going to ask you to knock on doors, talk to people, get on the phone and help us transform the American political system. Thanks for your support.",
      "1. Great question. Given the fact that Latin America is our next-door neighbor, I have been very distressed about the lack of attention that we have paid to Latin America. I applaud President Obama's effort to normalize relations with Cuba, a country which I have visited on several occasions. But I think much more can be done to bring the United States and Latin America closer and to improve relationships with a continent that faces many economic and social problems.\n\n2. No I don't think six debates are enough and we will be interacting with the DNC to try to create a situation where we have as many debates as possible. There are huge issues facing our country. Candidates are entitled to different points of view. The American people need to hear a serious discussion on these issues, so I hope there will be far more debates than what the DNC has proposed."

      "That's a personal question. I've never had any problems answering that. I've never been at home seven night a week cooking for the kids. What I've instilled in the kids, from day one, is a work ethic. So, the time we spend together is limited, but it's quality. But, I made a conscious decision eighteen years ago when I opened the restaurant *Gordon Ramsay*, to strive to earn my third Michelin Star, I never wanted to open it weekends, so we closed Saturday and Sunday. So, they wouldn't see me eighteen hours a day Monday through Friday and they'd see me absolutely fucked on Saturday morning. But, we got to spend the quality time together. How does that resonate today? I only took them there for the first time two years ago. Because there was no way on earth that I was ever going to introduce to them that level of food and be served by twenty waiters and waited hand and foot on because it was their daddy's restaurant. I need to protect them and respect the restaurant and team in my restaurant. I made them as normal as possible, like I said, from the beginning they had a work ethic. They've all got jobs, they've all taken care of animals, they've all got housework. There's a rotor. They get pocket money, but they have to earn that pocket money. The well-respected Megan is at Oxford Brookes studying, she's doing a degree in Philosophy. Jack wants to be a marine. Holly was to go into fashion. And Tilly, Matilda, is the chef of the family. She has her own show on CBVCs on the BBC in the UK. They're all hard-working, passionate individuals that have respect for others and respect for life. And, more importantly, understand that if you want something in life, it's not passed over, a hand-me-down. They got to work for it. That's really important for me. \n\nListen, I was there. At his age at 39 and 29 and 19 behind the line. You have to make sacrifices. There's no fast-track to becoming successful. Yes, you can make it. 39 is not old and more importantly, be selective on what restaurant you're going to work in. If you're gonna go and spend eight to ten to twelve hours in a restaurant as a line cook then make sure it's a fucking great restaurant. Make sure they deserve your time and make sure every six months, you're climbing the ladder. Because if you're not then you're not working correctly and you're not playing to your strengths. Set aside that fact that your son is only five and don't look at the current situation and dictate that for the rest of your life. Climb the ladder, but make sure you're in a great restaurant. Don't try to climb the ladder in an average restaurant because you're not going anywhere. So, get yourself into a good restaurant. \n\nVery kind. Thank you. But there's one thing I learned as a young chef growing up and working my ass off in these restaurants. The sacrifice I was making was coming back tenfold in experience. There's nothing wrong with being behind the line, but being behind the line in a great place because at the end of that shift or that service, you're going back a much better person than you started the day with and that's what cooking is all about. And you've got to instill that, so make sure you don't waste time in the wrong restaurants. ",

So, yeah sometimes when you're in that built-up environment and you're in amongst sort of that tough, demanding pressure of Hell's Kitchen, getting out up into the mountains and taking the contestants out in the lake for the day, it does wonders for their mind.\n\nBut we can't use fucking live ducks and let them loose from a helicopter!

      "Pasta is a great way to show some great flair, in a way that, whether it's dry spaghetti or even fresh made Tagliatelle pasta. I would start off with a sort of roasted shallot, garlic, chili, fresh lime juice, with flaked crab meat over it. Once you've mastered the basics and so simply done like that, using pasta as a starch is with an amazing protein. So is it a beautiful caramelized breast of chicken on that pasta, is that amazing marinated slice of tuna. So start off with pasta, and that's really exciting to show off some great skills mastering pasta. If you really want to be the ultimate single guy, looking for the most extreme date, crank a little pasta machine, sit her down, serve her the most amazing glass of champagne, and just tell her to sit and watch for five minutes while I roll the pasta. Now rolling that pasta through the machine and cranking it down into those thin layers and all of a sudden you've got this tiny bowl of pasta, 5 minutes later you've got this 10 meter incredible rivered table of pasta.

      "That's an amazing question.\n\nFirst of all, I've been in your shoes, and what you need to do is take a break.\n\nSo I came out of my training in Paris, after getting my ass kicked in some of the best restaurants in the world. I took some time off, and got aboard a boat, and was a private chef on a yacht. And those 6-9 months off allowed me to regenerate.\n\nI'd run myself into the ground, as you described.\n\nCooking at this level is *so* intense. So don't give up. Be honest with yourself, and take a month out.\n\nNow if that month out - just stepping back - if there's one thing I've taught my young chefs today it's to work hard, and not get disillusioned with the bigger picture.\n\nThat's the most important thing about cooking - you may be working down the road for me here in Atlantic City, but you could travel the world and still get a job in the kitchen, and still get time off in the same time. So that's what i would suggest, stepping back for a month, shutting everything down, and then starting up again in 4 or 5 week's time. \n\nListen - if you send me your resume, I could look at putting you into one of the restaurants as a work experience, if you want to see something different, in order to make sure you don't come off the rails, to see something different, to create that level of interest.\n\nNever give up. But don't be scared to take a break. I did it myself, traveled the world, through Sardinia, Sicily, and had the most amazing time, and what i *learned* after that experience was that I could do in 1 hour on a boat what i was doing in 14-15 hours in the professional kitchen. It confirms what you've learned, when you walk into a new establishment. It shows how strong you are. ",

It makes me a little bit embarrassed. I'm so grateful. First thing I want to do is go to the kitchen and say hi to the team.

Sometimes, I've sort of jumped to a one course, just to get the hell out of there because things aren't going too well. ",
      "I've never really worried about the sort of media profile, early on in my career? I'm a chef. So I, you know, we don't get taught how to handle the media properly! And as you can probably understand, chefs when they start out make some pretty big mistakes in terms of saying things in the heat of the moment that get taken out of context, but I've always said that's passion.\n\nDo I swear? Two weeks ago, I was at a parent's meeting for my school. And my daughter said \"*Daddy, please don't embarrass me.\"*\n\nSO I get to the school and the first thing that happens - there's all these mums and dads there, and all the teachers are there, with the names on the table, and I see the head-mistress, and my daughter Holly was there, and it's *incredible* - I went straight up to the head-mistress and asked for a selfie! Which I thought was fucking brilliant.\n\nMy daughter dived under the table in embarrassment. But it just broke the ice. These things are just so formal.\n\nAnd the head-mistress said \"*Oh my LORD, I've never had a selfie before! What do we do!?!?\"*\n\nSo I said \"Put your head up and fucking smile!\"\n\nI tweeted it out. God bless 'er. ",
      "I...I multi-task very well.\n\nAnd I am never in one place too long.\n\nI think now with, you know, my own production company, I'm very lucky the schedule works around my diary. I work my ass off - you know, 15, 16 hours a day. I quite enjoy the time difference when I finish, for instance, last night we were taping MASTER CHEF until 9 or 10 PM at night, I'll have a quick bite to eat, and then I'll call the UK at midnight - because come midnight LA time, West Coast time, it's 8 o'clock in the morning. I'll say good morning to the kids, I'll catch up with my business in London, and then from 2-5 o'clock, I sleep, get up, go to the gym, and then start my day again.\n\nSo that's my daily slog.\n\nSo I stand by my convictions - when I opened up the restaurant, Gordon Ramsay, back in September 1998, I decided I was going to work my ass off. My flagship restaurant in Chelsea has never been open on a Saturday and Sunday - it's never been open on a week-end, because I thought if we're going to do this, I'd like to do this properly, so my staff needs time off. So I work hard, but I give myself time off on the week-end. I cut it off, and power down for 48 hours. ",
      "Heheheh! Are you mad? \n\nNo! \n\nI haven't. I just... I dunno. I get inquiries on the daily basis, in order top pick up on some of the press, and some of the stuff they continue to do. I think it's absurd. And I'm now on the verge of actually feeling sorry for them, because it's not correct.\n\nThey're one of a kind. \n\nI have no desire to come back. It was the only time I ever threw the towel in - where I physically *can't* do any more.\n\nWe tried so hard for that program, you know. We left them with descriptions to get the business back successfully, and even if restaurants don't follow your recommendations, you still get blamed for it.\n\nI'm frustrated with them. And I just wish they'd listen.\n\nYou know, them becoming sort of big online - I've seen some of the stuff they've been doing and saying, and it's quite embarrassing. It's quite embarrassing, in terms of what they're doing.\n\nI just wish they'd put their heads down, and let their business, you know, think for itself, rather than trying to react to every little sort of negativity.\n\nSo, yeah... they seem to go out on a limb to attack people, and take great pleasure in attacking people.\n\nIt's a bit weird. They've become so successful, for being so bad... ",
      "And also, it keeps that little bit of, you know, appetite there, and that keenness to perfect what you're cooking.\n\nSomeone said to me last night \"Never trust a skinny chef.\"\n\nAnd I said \"That's bullshit, never trust a fat chef.\"\n\nAnd she said \"Why?\"\n\nAnd I said \"Because they've eaten all the good bits.\"\n\nYeah!",
      "That's a very good question.\n\nOne thing we need to REALLY understand about Michelin is the stars are awarded to the restaurant.\n\nSo, you know, if there's one thing I've come to admire with the Michelin is that it's consistent. It's a guy who is judging you incognito. We have a lot of guys in this country, and Europe, who are a bit too familiar, too chummy with chefs, and they overindulge - food editors, they'll know, and tip off the chef. With a Michelin guide, you have *no* idea when they'll be in, or when they'll review you. And that's why they're the most feared and respected by chefs.\n\nNow I'm always asked - you're a hands-on chef, you're on TV, how come you're still with these stars? Who does the cooking when you're not there? \n\nWhen I'm not there, I have trusted proper chefs - like Clare Smyth, the chef de cuisine in Chelsea - even when I'm there, she's still running the ship. She's been running it there for 10 years.\n\nSo the stars are awarded to the restaurant. And sometimes the chefs think the stars belong to the chefs, but they belong to the restaurant. The service is just as important. Michelin's had a hard time in America, because it was late coming to the table. But if there's one thing I respect, it's consistency. They manage to identify consistently, and it's all there for the customer.\n\nSo when people ask me \"What do you think of Michelin?\" I don't cook for the guide, I cook for *customers.* ",
      "*Heheh!* Everyone thinks i have a glamorous breakfast, like a full English or eggs benedict. I keep it simple, because it reminds me of my mum. So I keep it simple, porridge, which is oatmeal. But growing up in Stratford-Upon-Avon, we kept it very simple, just oatmeal with water, salt, and oatmeal, because my dad said it would \"put hair on your bollocks!\"\n\nIt's really weird hearing you say the word \"bollocks\" Victoria.\n\nThe night before, put 3-4 bananas in the oven on a pilot light. And the next day, squeeze the bananas into almond milk, bring it to a boil, then add the oatmeal and dried cranberries, and you'll have the most *amazing* oatmeal for breakfast. ",
      "Ehm - any food I won't even try? That's a good question.\n\nI think, being a chef, the first thing that I set out to do was to make sure that I almost got to taste every ingredient anywhere in the world. I wanted to learn so much about ingredients that I'd never know what NOT to do with an ingredient.\n\nSo I'm an open book. Whether it's a beating cobra heart from a  snake in Cambodia, or a deep-fried tarantula, or a Beef Wellington, I'll eat absolutely anything.\n\nThe only thing I draw the line at, Victoria, is eating overcooked food. There is NOTHING worse than an overcooked brussels sprout. The smell is *disgusting.* ",
      "First of all, you shouldn't be in fucking bed this time of day. Jesus. It's midday. Secondly, salsa in bed? Jesus Christ. Chocolate dessert maybe, but salsa? \n\nVegan, that's a really good question. I would do the most amazing minestrone soup in a way that I would use the best vegetables, the best vegetable stock, and then I would finish that with some of the most fragrant herbs ever on the planet. There's a purple basil herb that grows indoors and it's so fragrant and so incredible. Finishing that was extra virgin olive oil. Beautiful. \n\nBut, I'm more concerned about salsa in a bed and in this time in the afternoon. We need to get you sorted. ",
      "Heh! Witty insults? Ehm... it just happens sort of spur-of-the-moment. I see red, I get frustrated, I let it go. I'm not very good at editing myself. I have to get things off my chest. If there's one thing my mum taught me, it's speak your mind, be firm, get things off your chest. I think it's a good way to work, and quite healthy to have that attitude. Do I think about it previously? No, they just come to me in a flashpoint. And sometimes even *I* sit back and think *Did I just say that?*\n\nAnd then jellied eels - you've got to go to the East End of London, and get the most amazing Malt Vinegar. They're very healthy, packed with protein, and bloody delicious. And the River Thames now, in London, is TEEMING with eels - so some of the best eels in the world now are from London! They're delicious. ",
      "Also, I have to say in a HUUB wet-suit, I look like I've got a fucking 8 pack. Which is unique about a chef in a wet-suit. It's incredible how toned you look. \n\nI recommend every chef put on a wetsuit. It makes you look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. ",
      "What do I use a microwave for? That's a bloody good question! There's an amazing way of drying herbs in a microwave. You get a plate, plastic wrap, and then rub a whole basil leaf in just a touch of olive oil and then lay it on the tin foil. Press for 45 seconds in the microwave. They come out crispy! It's almost like shallots fried but they get such a quick temperature, it dies and crisps out the basil leaves within seconds. So I do use a microwave, only to sort of lightly fry basil, tarragon leaves without deep fat frying. It's incredible. ",
      "Very good question.\n\nI have to say, scrambled.\n\nOver a slice of sourdough bread that has been grilled, and then sort of doused with Worcestershire sauce.\n\nNow scrambled eggs, I did a video a few years back with my youngest, Tilly, showing how to make scrambled eggs, and I think it has 10-11 million hits?\n\nAnd the nice thing about scrambled eggs is that they don't have to just be breakfast - you can have them in the evening, with some nice mushrooms, some tomatoes. You can have them as a snack at midnight, or at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. ",
      "A. This is a fucking serious cooking class\n\nB. It's me! On my own in my kitchen, so there is no reason to scream because I know what the fuck I'm doing. More importantly, I'm trying to get you the viewer up to speed, so sadly, no screaming. ",
      "My favorite Disney movie.\n\nEhm, come on? \n\nSeriously?\n\nIt has to be RATATOUILLE.\n\nI was very close, last year, when we had Bradley Cooper in the kitchen cooking up a storm for his new ADAM JONES movie coming up the end of this year, and understand his level of excitement about service, being on the line - he didn't want to tiptoe, he wanted to be in there, from first light to the last plate leaving the kitchen, and it was so nice to see how he respected the team. He didn't want pampering, he wanted to roll his sleeves up and dive in there.\n\nHe said \"Gordon, I just want you to teach me to put food on a plate, because it's really magical how you put food on the plate the way you do.\"\n\nSo I'm very excited for this movie, coming out, called ADAM JONES. It's very exciting to see an actor understand what you do, and knowing that he can't learn how to cook in a few months, but absolutely *nailing* it when it came to the level of presentation. \n",
      "I screamed at the whole government, because the difference in staying or exiting was 1.7 million people, and I don't think, you know, this whole catastrophic scenario should be based on just 1.7 million votes, in terms of the difference between staying and going. I thought it was a little bit unfair that the much older generation in this country that aren't dictating the economy, or have gone into retirement and lived their life, they've made it more difficult for the younger generation coming through. And so it was a bit unfair because those votes--no disrespect--weren't really important to the future of this country when they've lived their life and are now in retirement.\n\nSo, that was really awkward. And then, everyone thought that this money would be going to the NHS because it's 350 million. Nobody was told about the devastation and the ramifications of it. It was a lot more difficult, but with such a tiny majority, winning that vote, it should never have been in those people's power to determine what was happening with this country. Because, well the majority of votes were nowhere near big enough when you look at the consequences. ",
      "Waffles on Saturday, pancakes on Sunday. ",
      "Ehm - you know, sometimes it doesn't happen until 2-3 days later. No, I've never really got *sick,* but i was in a hotel last year in Vermont, and I didn't realize until I got home that I caught *nits* in the hotel.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd I did something really bad-  because I thought it was my daughter. I thought it was my youngest daughter, Matilda, and then it turns out it was *ME* with the nits. So I had my hair checked by my wife Tara, and I traced it back to the pillowcase in Vermont! So I apologized to Matilda. Because, you know, she's young and quite often kids get nits, and then my wife said \"Listen, you're wrong. Tilly didn't give you nits.\" \n\nRidiculous. ",
      "That's a really good question.\n\nI would recommend that you get adventurous with pulses - chickpeas, beans, lentils. And you know, cooking these is incredible. Brown rice? Phenomenal. You don't need expensive proteins. Just make them incredible with how you cook them, or prepare them - a pressure cooker is a great way of making these foods go a long way, is to cook them deliciously. Chilis, garlic, definitely. ",
      "From Southeast Asia to India, and spending time in the Jungle. I was like a pig in shit, one of the happiest times of my cooking career. I've got maybe the next call for me, in terms of excitement, has to be South America. So I'm thinking of planning that next great escape across South America. Off the beaten track. No landmark, touristy, bullshitty, stadiums, just an inside to the culture that I'm trying to learn. Great escape is definitely coming back. Maybe Spring or Summer 2018",
      "First of all, *The F Word* for me was a programme that taught me the importance of sources of food. The F Word tried to highlight the place of origin. How often do you go out for lunch or dinner, and you don't know where the food comes from? So the F Word tried to show the importance of that journey.\n\nI've become a big fan of Vietnamese and Cambodian food. Because they cook with very little dairy. SO everything was tasty, but incredibly healthy at the same time. Great use of spice, broth, pork, a way of eating *well* but also JUST on the cusp of trying to stay healthy at the same time. \n\nSo, you know, when I travel across the US, I always try to get off the sort of main \"foodie\" - the main, sort of high streets, and get into little foodie quarters. If it's South New Orleans, or Austin Texas, I'm going for the latest little thing that's just opened. So I'm pretty low-key like that. I like going into some sort of off the beaten track areas. ",
      "So the easiest dish to turn into something awful would be, for me, cooking a great steak. Serving a New York strip, for instance, for me the most important thing is taking it out of the fridge 15 minutes before you actually use it, so it gets to room temperature. Season it properly, and then cook it once it's up to room temperature.\n\nAnd then the biggest mistake that people make once they've cooked a steak, instantly, is they cut into the middle of it. You've got to let the steak rest for as long as you cook it. That way, it's plump, it's juicier, and don't worry about the temperature being piping hot, but just the value and the difference in flavor once you've let a New York strip rest for 6 or 7 minutes. The difference is night and day. So, great sear, but let it rest.\n\nFood that really pleasantly surprised me more than anything, you know, I'm all about dressings and vinaigrettes, especially this time of year. So, making a great salad is making sure that you dry those leaves, because if the salad is damp, you'll never taste that vinaigrette. So there's so many certain ways, with fresh honey, basil, lots of herbs and vinaigrettes that can make it so much more interesting. So I'm all about that kind of lightness, especially over these next couple of months.",
      "Chef's pick.\n\nSo I don't really sit down and do lunch. I certainly don't sit down and eat dinner.\n\nI have a breakfast with oatmeal, that's the first thing, and that sets me up for the rest of the day.\n\nIt's very hard to sit down for a 3 course meal, and I'm very easy to please. If i go out to dinner, I'll share an appetizer, enjoy my entree, and enjoy my dessert. It's very hard for me to enjoy a full meal, because I taste every 2 minutes in the kitchen.\n\nI'm not very good at sitting down for 3 hours to enjoy a meal. I'd be lying if I told you \"I sit down 4 nights a week and have a 3 course dinner.\" I do nothing of the sort. \n\nAnd also, there's nothing worse than eating dinner at 5:30 and then having to get up and cook for 3 hours. So I like to keep on my toes, and eat small bits. Almost like in Hong Kong - 4 or 5 times a day, small bowls of food. ",
      "That's a really good question.\n\nSo across the filming procedure, we get the chance to spend time with them, with basic culinary lessons. So they won't know *exactly* what they're doing, but we'll show them basic techniques a few weeks prior. And also, things like the croquembouche - we'll do a class in sheet pastry, but we'll do sheet pastry BUNS, as opposed to actually doing a croquembouche. \n\nWhen it comes to the more serious elimination challenges, they'll have insight 3-4 weeks out. We are halfway through shooting season 5 of Master Chef Junior, and I am staggered by the level of competition. We start taping tomorrow morning, but based on the standards of the first few seasons, the level is just amazing - they are coming in better, stronger. And for kids to have ballet lessons, soccer lessons, that's something we've grown up with. And I've never known kids like we're having now, who are having cooking lessons outside of school hours. ",
      "Wow, that's a great question.\n\nWell, negative - the WORST meal? There's been too many of them to tell you about, because the last ten years, working on KITCHEN NIGHTMARES, I've eaten a lot of crap. I think I've drank about THREE and half litres of Pepto-Bismol! And in terms of, you know, good meals - I had an incredible meal at the Black Liquor Market in Studio City. The most amazing Scotch eggs, deviled eggs, and then these short ribs that were braised in beer.\n\n*Incredible,* just incredible. ",
      "Shortcuts. Just people taking shortcuts to undermine the value of doing it properly in any profession. It really pisses me off. There's nothing worse than coming across a young chef that wants to take shortcuts to get the job done quicker. If you have the job done quicker, you're removing the essence and the true passion to why you're a chef in the first place. But just in general, whether it's a plumber, an electrician, or even a police officer, taking shortcuts and getting it done quickly for the sake of it is not the smartest idea. Do it properly or don't do it at all. ",
      "I would love it to happen. I'm pissed that it hasn't, and I've offered him a head start, I've offered to pay for his flight, I've offered to send a plane for him...here's the thing. Chefs need competition, and I think that's healthy. We both work for Caesar's; Caesar's put it on this table for this year to celebrate their 50th birthday for him and I to have a live cook-off, and Bobby lost his balls. It literally castrated him.\n\nI will be the first one to make sure that we go head to head in a live cook-off. How exciting would that be?! Come on!\n\nThere's a lot of chefs in America that I respect. I get a hard time from all those chefs, but I respect them immensely. So, it's no different than two basketball teams playing against each other. It's no different between America and Great Britain playing against each other in soccer. Have a bit of fun with it! It was going to charity, and don't get so stressed out! Come on! ",
      "I had an amazing doubled pork chop with rhubarb. Now rhubarb is something we literally eat with desserts, but this dish was incredible. It was in Spain. It was a double pork-chop that had been slow-roasted over an open pit fire with rhubarb. Absolutely delicious. This was one of my mates that was trying to show off cooking in his back garden in Spain when we were out filming for KITCHEN NIGHTMARES. I didn't think it was going to work, to be honest.\n\nAnd then when I started tasting, I thought *Shit! This is delicious!* ",
      "\nThat's a really great question. Last month we worked with Blue Apron on Master Chef, when they were setting the contestants a task. So I think when you're up against it, time wise, and you're short of time and you haven't got time to prep, it's a great idea to sort of increase the confidence in your cooking, whenever it's laid out in front of you. So, I look at the Blue Apron as almost like a mystery box challenge. So I welcome the idea.\n\nWould I use it 6 or 7 nights a week? No. But, to start off with, understanding your portion control, no wastage, and getting up to speed with the combination of ingredients...it's a really good idea. But once you've used it 4 or 5 times, that should give you sufficient confidence to go out and buy your own ingredients, and be a little more experimental and have a little bit more fun with it.\n\nSo yeah, good idea, and it's a great way of gaining a lot of confidence in cooking when everything is laid out in front of you.",
      "So opening the steakhouse in Vegas was one of the most daunting and dangerous things I've ever done. The team are brilliant. I visit my steakhouse about 12 times a year, and we cook dinner only.\n\nSo, I grew up to speed about 15 years ago when I first started coming to the US about how well they did steakhouses. I sat, watched, absorbed, and learned; and when I got the chance to open Gordon Ramsay Steak, we actually have an impact on the scene. So yeah, there's my DNA. The standard is incredible, the staff is friendly; but it's got that really cool Britannia feel, and I'm all over it like a rash. I talk to them on a daily basis through email, but that restaurant means such a lot to me personally that, yeah I spend a lot of time there. So yeah, that's definitely the real deal. ",
      "Good question! I got into running & doing triathlons - first of all, I've run over 15 marathons and doubles (ultra-marathons) in South Africa. So I needed a bigger sort of commitment, to spend a little bit more time to myself. So - listen - I love running, but it's given me quality time to spend on my own. SO I got into triathlons about 3 years ago, and it's helped me to stay even more focused in my day to day job. ",
      "So the Achilles is a slow, painful injury that takes time through rehab. So four weeks ago today I had the surgery; I'm still in incredible pain, but it is definitely getting better. Thank you! I've got arms, my arms are like my thighs now, and I look like freaking Popeye. So on crutches I'm not very good, but my arms are huge.\n\nSo eight seasons of Masterchef, there's about 7 or 8 dishes that stand out today that I still remember. Eric from the Firehouse in Brooklyn, New York, made an incredible dish in the early rounds of Masterchef regarding a New York strip, and he garnished it with these wild mushrooms, but the sauce was *incredible*. So, Christine Hart that I mentioned earlier, she made this incredible apple pie, and it brought tears to my eyes. She was doubting her ability, she was doubting the level of execution, and she was upset with something that she couldn't see or taste it, but it blew my mind. I still revert back to that amazing apple pie. And this was made by a lady that sadly lost her sight.\n\nSo, yeah I'd go Eric in terms of his protein, and Christine Ha with her apple pie. ",
      "So the first thing I would want to order if I see it, if there's a Wellington on any menu, whether it's in the middle of Milan or the middle of Paris or the middle of New York, I grew up with beef Wellingtons. We have a national Wellington Day here in Britain now, and it's so nice to see everybody attempting to do it. I get thousands of messages and pictures a week of people across the world showing me their Wellingtons. So if I see a Wellington on some other chef's menu, that's the first thing I'll go to. And even though it's often done for two, I'll order it for one, and pay double just to make sure I get to see it.\n\nBased on the success of the burger I served in Vegas with Planet Hollywood, we have a percentage of chuck, all beef with a fat percentage of 10%, brisket and chuck, and then short rib. So for me, the secret behind any great burger is the fat content. But, if you want to take it to another level, as it's caramelizing on the charcoal grill, or a wood-burning grill, basting your burger with Devonshire butter puts a completely different spin on it. If you can put fresh chiles in that butter, or a red wine reduction, and make that butter unctuous, delicious, rich...wait until you see the flavor difference, the profile of basting your burger with butter. Brushing it over. The difference is night and day.\n\nMarco was great, I mean a total hard-ass. The guy has turned into a pussycat now, and Australia loves him. I remember him for the way he taught me to put food on the plate with such disciplined fingers. But one of the most inspirational chefs I've ever had a chance to work with, that would have to be Guy Savoy in Paris. You know, I was 22 years of age, I was on my knees, I didn't have a pot to piss in, and I was working on the lowest salary anywhere in France. But, that guy gave me hope, he gave me light, and he gave me support. So yeah, I'd say Guy Savoy in Paris. It's funny now, but we see each other in Vegas, because we've got restaurants in Vegas now, and his name's above Caesar's Palace and I'm behind him. So, it's pretty incredible.",
      "I think one of the most practical knives I've been working with throughout is Henckles knives. Henckles knives, incredible. I'll tell you why. The secret of a great knife is in the handle. Because if you've got a firm grip and you feel comfortable and secure with the handle, you chop, you slice, much better. So, Henckles knives, for me, are one of the most versatile and definitely one of the most rounded, but the elaborate handle makes for such a more comfortable chop, slice. It's like driving a car. A steering wheel. It's like putting a pair of gloves on. You need to feel tight and smooth and in control of it. So, it's all about the handle and Henckles knives, by far, are one of the most practical.  ",
      "1.) Ehm, good question. The biggest piece of advice - you know, cooking is about character. It's about different cuisines. And I think sometimes we go into it a little bit blinkered-vision. *Learn* a second vision - I thought I really knew how to cook when I worked for Marco and then when I went to France, it really opened my eyes. So learn a second language, and *travel.* It's really important to travel. That is *fundamental.* because you pick up so many different techniques, and learning a second language gives you so much more confidence in the kitchen. \n\n2.) Very good question. First of all, you know, you can't find a substitute for such incredible ingredients. It's very, very difficult. So, you know, a lot of difficulties in terms of trying to find substitutes, so you have to develop recipes with  great alternates. I was recently sent an amazing array of sauces, and dishes, by a company that didn't use eggs. The company was called \"Just Mayo\" but it was done without eggs yet it tasted ABSOLUTELY incredible. So try to figure out a recipe without eggs, because when it's that dangerous, the backlash could be *incredible.* ",
      "Yea, here's the thing, a) I'm not an editor, b) I'm firm but fair, and c) I'm just brutally honest!\n\nSo sometimes that comes off like an ass. Could I be smarmy, and sickly, and sort of weak and act like dick for the camera? No, that's not my style. I'm brutally honest, I'm firm, and I'm incredibly passionate. Sometimes that gets misconstrued for anger. I always say don't judge me personally, judge the results. How I get there, that is my demeanor. Judge the results, not me. ",
      "I have an amazing cocktail, which, you know, we're in Atlantic City currently, because we just launched the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill here, which is where we're calling from now. \n\nIt's with Tanqueray Gin, and it's called \"Wake up you Donkey!\" I mean, hahahahaha - it is incredible. And also, it's quite sort of spicy, and fragrant, and it's absolutely delicious. ",
      "Tomatoes, first off. Whether it's going in salads, whether you're roasting them to make soup, definitely tomatoes. And there are some great root vegetables. Parsnips. Parsnips are amazing through autumn and fall. Not just roasted, but in incredible soups. From parsnips to carrots. Again, carrots, mmm, amazing. They grow easily and it's a sort of dream vegetable. Again, great for pickling, great for salads, but incredible roasted and even better in soups. From there, brussel sprouts. Brussels sprouts, again through fall, through winter. An easy vegetable to grow, packed with flavor. Finally, the ultimate would be a great cabbage. I had a cabbage last night in a great restaurant in L.A. called \"Charcoal\" and it was Citrin’s restaurant and everything was cooked in charcoal. So, he blasted cabbage for like three minutes in stock, wrapped it up in foil, and then baked it inside this charcoal and the flavor was incredible. So, there would be my top five choices of vegetables. ",
      "Everything is getting very IT-led. We're having restaurants now that you're going in and ordering off iPads, etc, etc. So, we're missing this sort of personality of what restaurants should stand for. I'm slightly nervous about technical equipment, ya know, stoves, fires, immersion blenders using to cook, if we become over-elaborate with the science and technology of a kitchen then we're missing that human connect. I'm a firm believer in understanding textures and touching and tasting and smelling. So, I've seen a little too much of the sort of iPad scenario in restaurants. And it's just we're missing that element of fun and we can't over computerize the restaurants. Recently, the idea of robot chefs, are you honestly going to fucking tell me a robot has got a palate better than Gordon Ramsay? Fucking do me a favor. The quicker the batteries run down, the better.

      "Oh, gosh.\n\nI don't really get a chance to sort of look at the internet. D'you know what? I love that level of connection, and I try to show as much as I can, who I'm with, where I am, and giving people inspiration, so I don't really think of myself as a phenomenon on the internet.\n\nI'm a cook. Who happens to be the luckiest cook in the world. ",
      "For me, duh, around my house, everyone's expecting fireworks, for obvious reasons. So, what would I do if I was treating my mate in dinner tonight?  Some of the butternut squash currently out there is amazing. So, I'd do a roasted butternut squash risotto, finished with the most amazing sort of brown sage butter and then for my entree, I'd do a braised cabbage with a roasted loin of venison finished with a sort of red wine sauce that's been thickened with a dark, bitter chocolate. And then for dessert, I'd go for something absolutely stunning. I'd go for a classic lemon tart. Something that is very citrusy. Clean and delicious. ",
      "That's a very good question because every time we do something really high-end, costly, and shiny, I need to go do something really raw and cutting edge. So, *Sharkbait* was an amazing documentary where I went off to Taiwan, got on a boat, hijacked it, and you know, tried to stop finning--shark fins and the decimation of sharks and the population. So *Sharkbait* was one of the biggest and most prolific I've ever done.\n\nAnd then I think, I love going live. Cooking live, and nobody knows, but I can actually cook for 60 minutes live across the nation without cursing once. It's fucking hard, but I'll have a good go. ",
      "This country's spoiled. From East Coast to West Coast to Central to Seattle to San Fran. I took a bunch of mates on my 50th birthday last November, and I was up to my  eyeballs in pressure. Launching a new restaurant in Vegas, *Master Chef Junior* taped at the same time. But on my actual 50th birthday, I share the same day as my daughter, Matilda, so it's her 15th. I took a plane out of Van Nuys. Flew half a dozen of my friends over, my best mates. I finished work at lunchtime, flew to San Francisco, had a table of ten booked at *Saison*, had the most exceptional ten-course dinner finished and then flew back to LA and started work the next day. And that for me has been one of the best dinners I've ever experienced. And that was my second time there. In order to confirm how good a restaurant is, first time experience is important, but to confirm how good it really is, is to go back and check it out again. And it was even better the second time round. That's quite rare. ",
      "*The 'F' Word*, for me, is quite frankly one of the biggest shows I'll ever launch.  We’re live. So, we've got some really exciting things in the pipeline. I think it's going to be bigger and better than what we did in the UK. Why? There's a couple of stunts in there. In terms of we've got some really exciting VIPs. We have families that are competing against each other to find the best family across America. We have an amazing restaurant that you'll come to live in the middle of service and then there's some secret challenges that I'm up against to put myself into jeopardy. I love pressure, so this is not about me standing in a suit on a stage presenting, all that bullshit's gone and I've never been into that. So, this is something quite unique in a way that high octane, fun, we are gonna go up and gonna go down, and more importantly, live. My big question is are Fox mad to give me a live, 60-minute show?\n\nI've come up with great alternatives to cursing words. So, as opposed to saying \"shit\", I'm going to go \"shiiit-ake mushrooms\". As opposed to saying the word \"fuck\", I'm going to go \"fffruuuctose\".",
      "Good question! So my favorite beer would be, right now Innis & Gunn. And that is an amazing beer that is brewed inside a smoked bourbon cask. It's got a really nice, dark rich hoppy flavor that goes brilliantly well with burgers. But, it's almost like a celebratory beer. Yeah, Innocent Gun. ",
      "\nSo, I would say take an incredible scrambled egg recipe and...how do you synthesize that into something incredibly glamorous? I put sea urchins inside a scrambled egg once, and it was a sort of sea urchin butter that I had leftover, and it elevated scrambled eggs into something really different, and it gave it a really nice sort of salty, fresh, creamy flavor. So we have it on the menu today in our establishment, and it's topped with caviar, but it was amazing to see what sea urchin can do, finished and whipped inside a scrambled egg. Incredible!\n",
      "As a chef, I think my job is to discover as much as I can, and that was the first thing I did when I started cooking. I wanted to be in a situation where I never did not know what to do with an ingredient. So what's the kind of food I don't eat now? You know, anything black or underseasoned I find really hard to eat. So I'll eat anything from a beating open heart, live, to a jellied eel, to beans on toast. I'll eat anything provided it's got season. ",
      "\nMy favorite moment on Masterchef was when Christina Tosi and I were in the middle of a field and we were about to go head to head with red team versus blue team, and we were doing a coin toss. Christina flicked the coin, and fell flat on her ass. And it was that funny moment, that it was like, *oh my god*, one of the best pastry chefs in the world can't even flip a coin! And she flipped, and she slipped on her Wellies, and she did the splits, rolled on her back, got covered in mud, and it was all over the flip of a coin. It was *so* funny. ",
      "Depends on the topping. So, if I was going for a sort of Italian style sort of salami, pepperoni, hot then thin. If I was going for something a little bit more classic, Mid-West style, I'd go thick, but generally, 75% of them are all thin. Thin thin thin, all the way.",
      "First of all, pressure is healthy, it only becomes stressful when you can't handle that. How did I find that balance in my life? Honestly, I'd say about 12 years ago, I was struggling under immense pressure and I was finding it very difficult to switch off, so I started running. I ran like a sack of shit for the first 18 months, I was terrible. I remember my first match, someone shouted by the bridge halfway, \"Ramsey, where's your sports bra?\" So, apart from taking abuse on my first ever match and finishing in the dark, I started running. That gave me more time to myself and I could sort of process the pressure and recharge my battery. It sounded a bit weird because I was in the kitchen since 7:30 in the morning breaking at 2 or 3 in the afternoon, in the gym for an hour, and then back at 5:30 or 6, and stay until around 11 or midnight. That one hour in the gym a day completely distressed me. I couldn't run every day.  Every other day, I could run. After marathon, I took up triathalon because that gave me a little bit more time to myself. Weather it was swim in the morning. A long bike ride on the weekends. Triathlons saved my life. That put things in perspective in a way I could claw back, valuable, independent time that took me away from the hustle of running production companies to major networks, to the pressure of the Michelin Guide. I found that balance and that release, and that's really important. The busier I got, the fitter I got. I think it's the same in science, in the way that you need to be disciplined to take that time out, spend 90 minutes every other day processing what you got and what you're doing. I think a lot of the bike, I think a lot on a swim, I think a lot on the run and that's really good important time for me. ",
      "My guilty pleasure with food would have to be cookies and crack pie. Working with Christina Tosi over the last 2 years...If it's my birthday, she'll send me a cracked pie, if I'm staying at the Nomad Hotel in New York, she'll send me a box of cookies. Honestly, I don't give a damn about that cracked pie having three thousand calories per slice. Just getting in there is incredible. I suppose the more stuff I eat like that, I suppose the harder I train. I sort of torture myself, in a way, like \"right I've just eaten two cookies, I feel like a fat bastard. I just eaten half a cracked pie. Tomorrow's training session is going from two hours to four hours.\" So I'll eat the calories but I'll make sure I burn them off within 24 hours. My thoughts on the In and Out Burger, I wish that they were set up in London because if there's one thing I miss flying out of LA, it's an In and Out Burger.",
      "My parents had a one-bedroom flat here in the Midlands, and my parents' landlord was Indian. And we got to LOVE great curries from an early age. Mum and dad never owned a house, and they were sort of, almost... in honor of their landlord, because he taught my mum how to make the most amazing curries. So I was 5, 6 years of age when I started learning about the most amazing curries. Now to perfect it, I did a trip where I spent 3 months in India, from the North to the South, from the outskirts of Bombay to Kerala, I had an amazing time traveling across India and perfecting what I learned at an early age. ",
      "About 12 years ago, we started the \"The 'F' Word\" on channel 4 in the UK and, whilst all their friends at school were getting Xbox's and video games, I bought the kids animals. I started off with turkeys. After turkeys, we progressed to Royal Berkshire pigs. Then I bought them lamb and from there u/Jer-o-nimo, what I taught them to do was a, look after these animals, to respect the actual product when it hits the plate, b, part-time jobs cleaning out the pens, massaging the pigs with baby oil to protect their skin in the sun. And understanding that these turkeys are raised to eat, to celebrate, whether it's Thanksgiving or Christmas. So, I bought them all animals. \n\nNow, I took a lot of criticism for it, but I set up with them going into supermarkets and understanding that food wasn't supposed to be wrapped in plastic wrap and on a shelf. They need to understand where it's from. That's what I did. It got a little bit emotional when they... ya know.. Obviously, they didn't come to the frickin slaughter. I wouldn't do that. We have the two pigs, for instance. They had a pig each. And we fed one of them a cherry beer and we could taste the difference when we came to braze that pork belly. One was, obviously pigs are vegetarian, but we fed one beer and it was just the most amazing experiment. Look at what goes on in Japan, when they're massaging the Wagyu, etc, So, I wanted them to understand the traceability of great product. And they wasted less, they respected it more, and they understood the importance of rearing animals properly and humanely. There is a big lesson. Now Tilly was only 3 when she found herself with this turkey, ya know, 12 weeks out before Christmas. Within 7 days of her landing this turkey in the back garden, 24 hours later I found the bird upstairs in the frickin bedroom. ",
      "\nI would go down the rouse of recently we've been using lots of dry spaghetti, with lots of coffee garlic, chili, preserved lemons. Once we've roasted off the garlic, the chili, the shallots folded in the spaghetti, olive oil. We've been putting some really nice cans, tuna, over the top of the spaghetti, so it's almost like a sort of quick fish past the dish but your using cans, very good cans, of tuna. with some fresh capers, parsley, and a little bit of preserved lemon. Delicious! ",
      "Excellent. That's a really good question. Chickpeas. I lived in the south of India, just outside Kerala. I went into this amazing Ashram. They made this incredible chickpea curry, with a fresh masala, and it was done in a tomato gravy. The flavor honestly was incredible. Yea, chickpeas, absolutely incredible! Celery, onions, vegetables, it was incredible. The only thing you need to do is cook the chickpeas in a pressure cooker, make a fresh masala, lots of ginger, lots of tamarind, fresh tamarind. You won't need protein, chickpeas. Just make sure, you go to the bathroom before you past wind. Don't do it at the table because it lingers beyond belief!",
      "Haha, yea, I mean, the scary thing for me is getting legalized in a different states across the country. I understand the purpose of it for medicinal use, I get that, but I'm slightly nervous that if it's legal without an issue medically, we can have a nation as high as a kite. Food wise, I get high off perfection, I don't need cannabis.",
      "Great question! That depends on schedule. Let’s take a day in the restaurant for instance, we'll do a tasting where we'll put 6 dishes up to nominate 2 to go forward to go onto the lunch menu. I don't get back and open my fridge start cooking. I clock my day from 8 in the morning to 10 at night with food at my fingertips. So I'm the world's worst person to go back and cook. Because I’ve been eating all day and last thing I do when I get home is literally cooking. If I had to go downstairs now and open my fridge, I'd open up the fridge, you'd find a bottle of Whispering Angel Rose, I'd have a glass of that and maybe nibble on some cheese. So chef's graze like cows, all freaking day, small bits, 10-11 times a day and that does me perfectly. ",
      "For the rest of my life, cast iron. The longer you continue cooking in those, the more depth of flavor there is. Non-stick, after a while, at least two and a half, three years, it loses that non-stick. But, listen, the caramelization that takes place in the cast iron pan, whether it's an incredible thigh of chicken or roasting scallops or even making the most amazing caramelized apple tarte tatin. Cast iron pan will last generations. A non-stick pan will last twenty-four months. ",
      "I work incredibly hard. I have about 3-4 hours a day off and I work my freakin ass off because I get so excited with projects! I never started cooking because I wanted to become rich, I have an incredible about of energy. One day I will slow down. I think for me the app was a fun thing to do because it gives you a little bit of excitement in the industry of what's happening, how much creativity you have, and handle that pressure. What's next..we're talking, right now, about something really exciting in America, regarding The F Word. My dr\neam is to bring The F Word to America. That has lots of excitement, lot of content, a lot of foodie elements that I think would go down well. So that's what we're working on right now. I'll reveal more in a month's time but I'm really excited about The F Word. Finally, potentially, making it's way toward America. ",
      "Big fan of toasties, big fan of cheese, living in France for three years, it's one thing I grew up loving there was cheese, and now I'm obsessed over it. So, Red Leicester is a really beautiful cheese; it's a very strong, mature cheddar. But Red Leicester is an amazing cheese. It's made in Devon now, with great sheep's milk. Strong mature cheddar that gets sort of caramelized and bubbly is the best for a toastie. I'm not a big fan of salted cheese; I much prefer a nice rustic, mature cheddar, not so salty. ",
      "Second part of the question first, Angler's Lodge was just one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen in the history of this program. So that was a family-built hotel; mom and dad fragmented through the loss of their son through a tragic accident, but the place was just gorgeous. And the parents were incredible, and it was just devastating to see the heartache that was caused on losing their son, and how they became recluses and then gave up. So, giving them that confidence and support in reestablishing that lodge and putting that back on the map was one of the best and most heartfelt programs ever.\n\nOne of the most frustrating programs, well probably the hotel last night, the Brick Hotel outside of Philadelphia, where the restrooms in the hotel were almost stuck in a time warp, and the grey curtains were white curtains back in 1991. And just the filth, and just the general sort of deterioration of this building. As a pillar of the community, and having a hotel on your doorstep with the local community is really important, but it doesn't mean to say that you have to make money from that community. But supporting that community, and being open to locals, as opposed to closing your door on locals, was the worst they could ever do. So I think last night's program was the one that, for me, was one of the most frustrating hotels because the manager / owner was sort of ripping off the locals. And out of season, the locals--and in season--man that's your bread and butter. You have to look after them. And there is one or two ways across that hotel that you can appeal to them without sounding cheap or without sounding that you're degrading. ",
      "Yea, there's been lots that I've been proud of. Christina Wilson, who won Hell's Kitchen 3 years ago, to see what is is doing now in Vegas and how prolific she is has been brilliant. Christina Hart, the blind cook on Master Chef, she is not presenting Master Chef Vietnam, she's involved with Master Chef Australia. I have a look with some of the youngsters  that we have been working closely with over the last 3 years on Master Chef Jr. Young Addison, Logan, Alexander. We are taking about 8-sort of 12/13 year olds, seeing the way the can be better and not being spoiled by the exposure of having a reputation on TV. They are focused on their job at hand and continue their passion. I'd say there are about two dozen individuals over the last 4-5 years. Those aren't necessary all those who came in first of second in the competition, I'm talking about contestants who have been in the top ten, top five, so yea, there's a lot that I'm proud of. ",
      "First of all, I’m a speedfreak, so I love that level of adrenaline. 2 or 3 times a year, I'm very fortunate if I get onto a track and I race. I don't race on the normal roads. So, big car fan. \n\nLast year, I saved up my pennies and got the ultimate car and it was a LaFerrari. They only made 499 of them, so when I got the call from Marinella, the Ferrari factory in Italy, honestly, I've never felt so happy. The happiest I felt last time was either when I received my 3rd Michelin Star or when our eldest daughter born. When I went down to the track at Marinella in Italy to pick up LaFerrari, honestly, you know what, I wouldn't leave the garage. I literally slept by this car for 2 or 3 hours. It was beautiful. It is a gunmetal gray, matte black roof, carbon fiber finish, and just the ultimate experience. Strapped myself in and when I took it for a ride, I was just like wow, this is incredible. Having gone to school in one of the shittiest cars ever imaginable. With more rust on the inside than the outside of my dad's car. I used to ask him to drop me off from school a mile away from the front gate, out of embarrassment for the car. God bless him. So, to be in that Ferrari, it was just insane. It's in storage and I get them delivered to a track to race them purely on the track. Never on the road. I have a collection of them, so every time I win a Michelin Star, I add another Ferrari to the collection. ",
      "u/WolfCinema, first of all, I'm very happy you got a new wok for Christmas. That's great news. Cheesesticks. I thought that it was going to be a little bit more adventurous. \n\nThe best thing to do first is put your cheese into the freezer for five minutes before you put them in the breadcrumbs. Most importantly, make sure that you flour, egg wash, and breadcrumb them totally because you need to seal the cheese to prevent it from leaking. You don't need to cook the cheese. So, the best thing to do is to cook them shallow fried very, very quickly and all you're doing is, literally, turning the breadcrumbs golden brown. But, there's a great way of doing this quickly and that is take your Panko bread crumbs and blend them in a blender, so they become finer and therefore, they cook quicker. Because if you overcook them then obviously the cheese will start melting and it will burst through there. Or you can double coat them. So, flour, egg wash, breadcrumb and then do that again. If you put a second coating on top, slightly thicker, it will protect the cheese. But, the easiest way is to put the cheese in the freezer for fives minutes to get it nice and firm before you flour, egg wash, and breadcrumb. ",
      "I will definitely go back to Glasgow, We are currently looking at a site in Edinburgh and a site in Glasgow. It means a lot to me to go back there. Losing my head chef from that restaurant broke my heart, so I can't wait to open up again in Glasgow. It would be a dream come true again. Definitely! ",
      "First off, New Zealand, I fell in love with. The people remind me very much of the British. Hard working, head down, the projects that are coming out of there. I've had a chance to work with a dozen incredible talented New Zealand chefs in the group and we still have them today. There was a request  literally a couple of weeks ago to do with the New Zealand tourist board to go down and spend time with the most amazing purveyors farmers. Unfortunately had to be done before the end of February. I just couldn't get the time in my diary. For the visit to pop down there. I now really missed out because I had dates that I couldn't change.  My diary is planned 12-15 months in advance. To do with charitable work, dates in Paris, Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, London, South America, my diary is ramped but I got excited to go back to New Zealand but I couldn't change two of the dates in my diary. I was so close to being back in New Zealand in literally 4 weeks time. I just want to say about those key messages, in terms of the passion and discipline required to be successful in life, wasn't about money and status, it was about finding that key that unlocks that passion, that can be applied to any walk of life. That is where you get the most enjoyment. If I don't think that I have a job and I don't think I have a 9-5, I put myself in this position because of the burning desire to enjoy my passion. I think that is what I was trying to put across in master class and I think that resonates in New Zealand. ",
      "Every time I'm in Philly, that's the first thing that I go for. I love an extra mature cheddar on top of my Philly cheese steak, I don't want the steak over sliced, sometimes they slice it so thinly that they take all the goodness out of it, I prefer a chunkier steak inside the sandwich and an extra mature cheddar.

      "So what am I most proud of? Professionally, still having the same team that opened up restaurant Gordon Ramsay in 1998 with me today, the same chef, the same maître d', 18 years later. Retaining the 3 Michelin stars that we've done now, for 14 years, being London's longest restaurant serving with that recipient of 3 Michelin stars.\n\nAnd then on the personal front, obviously, you know, this industry fragments a lot of families. If there's one thing I've learned with my children, teaching them how to cook early on in life has brought them closer to my industry. So if they're gonna follow it as a career, they know how to cook. They've been cooking since they were 5. I just see the confidence it gives them, walking into the kitchen with their mates and cooking a dinner together. So watching them, let's say follow in my footsteps, but also understanding the essence of passion, and whether they become a police officer or a fireman, I've just installed that level of passion.\n\nSo, the time we spend is little time with the family, but it's quality. And they've respected that. All four of the children have grown up with that respect, and that, hey, if you want something in your life, you work hard for it.\n\nAnd then finally, I would say this December, I celebrate 20 years with my wife Tana. And based on that devastation last month with the miscarriage and losing our son, has made it an even more special anniversary.\n\nSo, I'm blessed with support, but more importantly, keeping life real, I think. That's been the most important part. ",
      "That's a really good question. The best way to get a start in any top kitchen in Europe is to knock on the back door because you don't get paid, just go and spend a couple of days, it will open your eyes up tremendously. Once you got in with one chef and you show them that you are that determined and focus, that's all you need to do. Once you've got your foot in the door, ask their help for the 2nd inside and the 2nd job. Once you've done one chef a great favor, by working in their kitchen, use him to get you into the 2nd and the 3rd restaurant. That's the way you look after talent, what we do in our kitchen. \n\nRegarding the job on the boat, I'd recommend any young chef, once they've chocked up some great knowledge and insight, to understand another culture, a different language. The only way I got to work on a boat, in the south of France, I went down there and I was very fortunate, I knew a couple of friends and customers. Go, literally, up to the boats, ask to speak to the captain. The best time in the south of France is March, April right through to September. For the Caribbean it's around November to March. Literally, walk up to the dock, ask to speak to the captain, show them your resume and tell him how hungry you are, in terms of drive and commitment, and that's the best way to get a job.\n\nBest marathon I ever did, my 4th of 5th London marathon, I've done 12, but #4 was my best time, at 3:30. My dream was to get under 3:30 but I missed it by 14 seconds. I came running down the strand, running past Buckingham Palace, and they stopped me! The BBC stopped me for an interview! I spent 35 seconds on an interview, knowing full well that I had broken my time, had I done my PB. I was coming down with like 100 meters to go, and I could see the clock turning like 3:29:55, I thought \"Oh shit!,\" \"Shiitake!\" So, I missed it by 14 seconds. Our eldest daughter, we have a foundation for the Great Ormond Children's Hospital. Megan, who is 18, she's got her first London marathon this April.  I’ve ruptured my achilles but  I'm going to try and run the last K with her to get her over the line. It's quite a busy household at the moment with everyone training. Especially for Megan. ",
      "That's a really good question, and I'm really glad that hubby is feeling better.\n\nWe had four young kids at one stage, and you have to get them involved with more of the prep as opposed to the cooking. Sooner or later, they're gonna have to use a knife. They're gonna learn how to chop. And there are great, cheap kid's knives that they can use and prep with.\n\nYoung, I get them organized. I started off teaching my kids with them and weighing out ingredients, prepping, peeling. But a really good way of making them excited and closely connected to it, is getting them to taste things. So as you're cooking, they may not be doing everything, but they're tasting things. Now that can't happen all throughout the cooking process, but I used to play games. I'd roll up fresh parsley, basil leaves, thyme flowers, and get them to smell, close their eyes and guess what it was. Cilantro, tarragon, chervil. And then I bought them all plant pots, so they cared for little miniature plant pots, and fresh basil, fresh parsley. And so they treated this plant as their little...how many times do you see hamsters or goldfish being bought? I bought all my kids little plant pots, basil plants, thyme, and they looked after them and they grew them. Outside herbs like rosemary. \n\nAnd so it's a really nice way of making them feel closer and a little bit more connected to food with the responsibility of looking after their little plants. They didn't have to be big, they were tiny plants. And then finally, it started being a little bit more family style cooking. My kids, for instance now, they roast sweet potatoes, and they scrape the sweet potato out of the shell, and they mix it with the most amazing ingredients--scallions, garlic, chili--and they put it back into the sweet potato. So, there are other ways of making sides a little bit more adventurous for them by getting them to sort of work more on the vegetable point of view. If they work closely with the vegetables, I guarantee they'll eat them easier and healthier. ",
      "Every restaurant is government scrutinized now with disabled accessibility. Whether it's with lifts or ramps, so it's only going to be a matter of time before these environments in the kitchen professionally will be a lot easier for disabled people to work here. I do have staff that are disabled with issues that we have overcome and we also keep our doors open for that. I'm glad that those provisions are in place for customers. I can't wait for that environment to become even more open for disabled employees. I work with Scottish Spina Bifida, because we set up an amazing center back in 2006, for Spina Bifida patients and families to receive a telling medical center help. That's a big charity for me. Kids sadly are confined to wheelchairs from 6-7 years of age. Our doors are open to all of interest and we will never shut it down.",
      "The favorite thing for me about hosting this class was the level of depth and intuition I could go into. Which is very hard to get it done in a restaurant based on literally a fully-booked restaurant, you can't cook like this in a restaurant. So to have the chance to cook like this at home, to give that proper breadth and depth of insight to every ounce of knowledge that I've got in my arsenal was important because it was uninterrupted. Uninterrupted cooking at the highest level. I would finish the day after a twelve, thirteen-hour shoot, I'd go this is incredible. It's very rare on a personal front that I ever get a chance to spend that amount of time doing nothing but just cooking. Coupled with the idea of talking about the journey, from the beginning to where we are now. Then self-processing that incredible life-long journey of getting to where I am today and that's the first time somebody's ever opened up and sort of got that close to me. That took a few days to warm up to the director and understand what he was doing and where he was going. So, that's never happened to me before in my career because I've never had the time to delegate to it. When I got asked to do this, to launch this, you know, it was important to me to do it properly. Without two-hour shoots and then move on to the next thing. I could properly cook, uninterrupted and that was the important part. ",
      "\nI see the rapid growing demands put on restaurateurs and chefs with dietary requirements and vegan/vegetarian alternatives. Pescatarian. Celiac. We get those requests every day, so in this incredible up and coming *Master Chef Junior* series, launching this Thursday, we put them under intense scrutiny to come up with a hamburger challenge. And the hamburger challenge is done creatively, but with no meat. So, give me the best vegetarian burger you could ever think about. I think that it's important to show kids you can eat well as a vegetarian without protein and make that burger delicious. Whether it's a mushroom burger done with incredible pesto. Just stop using protein and understand that vegetarian cooking is equally as important. I've already incorporated that into this season. Literally starting in the next three days.",
      "I've tackled some really key fundamentals across the MasterClass because we'd gone from, sort of, A to zed of cooking. More importantly, we've gone more in-depth in the way that, the Ultimate Cookery was not fast-tracked, but it was a very great series that was, I suppose, for beginners. The MasterClass is that we just finished taping is more in-depth because I've combined the journey because I wasn't up against any pressure from the network to create 30-minute episodes. This was sort of uncut, unedited cooking. Yeah, there's a lot of beautiful shots in there, but it got me opened up right to the very beginning. When I was on my ass in the middle of Paris at the age of 22 without a pot to piss in. I couldn't speak a work of French and it was make-or-break and I had to make it. I had to leave that city with the best knowledge that I've ever had. That's the difference. I think MasterClass is raw. I think it's brutally honest and it's uninterrupted. ",
      "That's why you use them in small, ultra thin slices! \n\nThe emails and the amount of feedback we've had has been extraordinary. I want to wait a bit, but, yeah. I'm definitely going to do another one and second time round, I'm going to go, this is a life-changing experience, so I wanna start off climbing the ladder together. The next one, I haven't even started planning it, but it will be more in-depth. And the only reason why I use that level of truffle at the end was to show you how you can take a scrambled egg to the absolutely premier league of dishes. A humble scrambled egg. And here's the final sign off, in terms of where are we as a nation for food. Last week, was historic for American cuisine because, for the first time ever, the American team won the Bocuse d’Or. Which is like the culinary Olympics in France. Set in Lyon. It was a game-changer. So, every amateur, every professional chef in this country now, you know, you've set the bar. The French, the Spanish, the Italian, the Swedes, the Scandinavians are all looking at you now as the world champions and you need to remember that. I am going to go off and start putting together a second Master Class based on the demand and the feedback because it's caught me at a stage in my career that I'm giving it to you over a certain amount of hours, days, and weeks, but I've spent decades doing it, so I'm glad you're enjoying it. Thank you for the support. "

      "I was born with good genes. That is really important when you think about health. For the rest of it, I don't really think about my health. I live each day, and I've been really lucky to be extremely healthy.",
      "Well, I first decided I wanted to go to Africa and live with animals and write books about them when I was ten years old. And everybody laughed at me, how could I do that, Africa is so far away. In World War II we had very little money. I was simply a girl. They told me girl students cannot do that. But I had a wonderful mother who had supported my love of animals ever since I was born, and she said to me if you really want to do this, then you're going to have to work very hard and take advantage of opportunity. That's the message I take to young people all around the world today, especially to those in under served communities. I came to study chimpanzees because of  the paleontologist Louis Leakey who wanted somebody to go with him and study them -- he believed we shared a common ancestor 6 million years ago and that we could learn from their behavior what early humans might have been like. When I discovered that chimpanzees make and use tools, and that they have complex emotions and a sort of \"culture\" no one wanted to believe me. When I went to get my Phd, there was a lot of push back. But I knew this was true - so I kept going. ",
      "Well, one highlight that really enabled my career to take off was discovering the chimpanzees used twigs and the brush to find termites in the underground nest because that is what went into \"National Geographic,\" which ended up providing funds for me to continue my research. So in a way, that was the pivotal observation that actually enabled everything else.",
      "As we look at what is happening in the world today, it is very, very grim. And because of that, a lot of people feel helpless, feel hopeless, and so they do nothing. And they fall into apathy and despair. So I have reasons for hope. I will share them quickly. One is the energy, commitment, and determination of young people and they are empowered to take action in programs like Roots & Shoots. Secondly, the human brain. We have this extraordinary weapon. We are finally beginning to use it to create clean green energy and find a new way of interacting with the environment and live in harmony with the other creatures. It's very strange, in fact the most intellectual creature to ever walk the planet is destroying it's only home. And I believe there's a disconnect between a clever brain and the human heart and compassion. Only when the head and heart work in harmony can we reach our true human potential. And this, I believe, is to come. From the resilience of nature, we can help to once again support life. Animals are on the very brink of extinction and we have to give them another chance. Next there is social media, which as we all know can spew out a lot of rubbish and misinformation. But, used in the right way, it means that for the first time in human history, we can bring people to together around the world who all care about a particular issue like climate change so that there can be hundreds, thousands, millions, eventually billions of people all raising their voices and demanding change so that we can make a big difference and politicians will have two listen and will have to make change. And finally, the human spirit. People who tackle what seems impossible and never give up. It's so important to realize that every single one of us has that same indomitable spirit. We just have to nurture it and let it grow to make a bigger impact for good.",
      "I'm not sure about the most surprising, but the most shocking was the fact they are capable of war. This was very horrifying and actually made them more like humans than I thought they were before.",
      "There is no question that chimpanzees have a very rich way to communicate many emotions, and information about the environment. But, I don't think we can translate that into anything like human language. However, chimpanzees can actually learn human-type languages. They can learn American sign language, 400 or more signs, and they can also learn quite sophisticated communication systems using computers.",
      "PLEASE NOTE: Response is from a member of Dr. Goodall's team, and not from Dr. Goodall herself.\n\nHi there!\n\nFirst off, thank you so much for nurturing a sense of scientific curiosity within Mathilda and Philippa, and for providing them with powerful female role-models (including yourself, of course!).\n\nFor Mathilda: Dr. Goodall will tell you that she was able to get close to the chimps due to her overwhelming patience and by staying very quiet. For months, they would run away in fear of her, but after a time they came to realize that she posed no danger to them. The chimpanzee, David Grey-Beard was the first to become relaxed around her after exploring her campsite.\n\nFor Philippa: Dr. Goodall does not have any pets of her own because she travels over 300 days a year and thinks it wouldn't be fair to an animal to leave them alone for that long. Her family has two dogs however, and she is always around animals whenever she travels, so she is never alone!\n\nThank you for your questions!!",
      "First of all, I would like to be remembered for helping to enable people to understand that animals are like us, their intellect and they have emotions like fear as well. Because up until the mid-'60s, it was actually thought that there was a difference in humans and the rest of the animal kingdom. And it was the work coming in, the early work, showing in how many ways the very biological system DNA and so forth that really changed. The other thing I hope to be remembered for is creating an environmental humanitarian program for people with Roots & Shoots, which is now in 100 countries. It involves members from preschool, kindergarten, universities, and everything in between. Its main message is every single one of us can make a difference. And make a difference every single day. Each group chooses themselves to help animals and wanting to help the environment. To educate young people to be better students, all the conservation work and other organizations to could benefit. And we've gone so far as destroying the planet, so the main hope is that the other people will grow up and do better than we've done.",
      "When I flew over the national park in the early '90s and looked down, I was utterly shocked. What had been stretching to the West Coast was now a tiny island surrounded by completely bare fields. People too poor to buy food from elsewhere. And struggling to survive. That is when it hit me. If we don't improve the lives of these people, there is no way we can conserve the chimpanzees. And that led to the Jane Goodall Institute program. We went not as a bunch of arrogant white people telling the villagers what to do to make their lives better, but with a hand-picked team sitting down, listening to the villagers, and asking them what they thought we could do to improve their lives. And that led to a very holistic program, which gradually grew and we could introduce new ways of helping. This paid off handsomely. The people in the villages are now our partners, helping us in conservation efforts. They've agreed to have a buffer between their villagers and the park to protect the chimpanzees. And the national Park, which was completely isolated, is now gradually being linked to other groups. And this program is now in 52 villages in the Gombe area, and it's in five other countries. And it is making a huge difference. Positive in introducing the youth program reaching the villages. It's probably the most important way in which we are able to conserve chimpanzee habitats. And I'll add to that, I would say we have placed great emphasis on education, helping them stay in school beyond puberty. We do this because it's been shown all around the globe that we all improve as women's education improves. One of our problems today is a growing number of humans. As our numbers grow, there are impacts and finite resources leading to more and more poverty and hunger.",
      "I think there's a growing tendency to explore the intellectual ability of all kinds of different animals, and now we even know trees and plants can communicate through pheromones spreading messages in the wind or through micro fungus in the roots sending messages through the ground. And because science has now opened its mind to the possibility of intelligence in creatures, we are learning so much more and it's a very exciting time.",
      "My favorite colour overall is green. There are times I like blue as well. I'm wearing blue today, by the way.",
      "I think that we can only make a real difference if everybody wakes up to the fact that we have caused terrible harm to the planet, and we need to rethink the way that we live in the Western world. We've fallen into a very materialistic, money-oriented way of living, and its placing enormous stress on the natural world. It's unsustainable, and we are told many of the nonrenewable natural resources are being exploited and used up faster than mother nature can replenish them. So, basically we all need to think about the consequences of the life choices we make each day. What do we buy, what do we wear, what do we eat, how is it made, is it from the environment, is there cruelty to animals or cruelty to children? And make choices thinking not only about how is this good for me now, but also how will this affect future generations. In other words, we need to do our part in the decisions we make, in our hearts and in our heads.",
      "I have already said that we can make a big difference by thinking about the consequence of the choices we make each day. Like what we buy. When it comes to what we eat, there is growing evidence that as more and more people and countries around the world eat more and more meat, this is not only involving tremendous cruelty to all the animals, but it's also having the most appalling effect on the environment. People don't always realize this. For one thing, areas of the world have been cleared to grow grain to feed the animals. And massive fossil fuel is used to take the grains to the animals and to slaughter the animals. Huge amounts of water, which is becoming increasingly scarce around the world. Huge amounts are wasted changing vegetables to animal protein. And finally, these animals, like us as well, food goes in one end and comes out the other. They belch as well as pass gas. Nothing is second most, it is very, very lethal. Of course, this is all leading to climate change and other great -- it is the greatest environmental issue facing our planet. One thing that is very, very helpful is to eat less meat or become a vegetarian or a vegan. ",

      "When I was growing up, what I read where the Doctor Dolittle books. I learned a great deal from those books. When I was ten years old I read \"Tarzan.\" I was sad when he married the wrong Jane. It was those books that directed me to grow up, go to Africa. For a 4-year-old child, one of my books I absolutely loved was \"Jane\" with illustrations by Patrick McDonnell. Which is fantastic. Another one, I want to mention is \"My Life With Chimpanzees\" which is a book I wrote for young children about my life with chimpanzees.",
      "PLEASE NOTE: Response is from a member of Dr. Goodall's team, and not from Dr. Goodall herself. \n\nHi there! In Gombe we have witnessed acts that could be considered altruistic on various occasions. One example being when an orphaned 3 1/2 year old chimp, without older siblings (whom sometimes adopt their younger siblings) was taken in by an adolescent male around 12 years old. The older male allowed the orphaned chimp to follow him around (even making sure he kept up while they were on the move), allowing the orphan to cling to his underbelly when the orphan was scared and/or cold, and even allowing the orphaned chimp to sleep in the same 'night nest' as him. This is especially interesting considering that the adolescent male was not related to the orphaned chimp in the least.\n\nThanks for the question!",

The program has just recently been introduced into it's 100th country and continues to grow everyday. \n\nSome advice she gives to everyone who asks though, is that you must think and act locally. Focus on issues in your own community. Map out any potentially hazardous areas (polluted rivers, beaches, parks) and gather support from there. If everyone were to focus on their local communities, then the impact would eventually be global.  \n\nThanks for your question! ",

Dr. Goodall did have a chance to pre-screen the newest POTA movie and found it very interesting. All of us at the Jane Goodall Institute are very appreciative of the steps taken by the production team of the new movies, due to their use of motion-capture and their dedication to not using real apes in any of their films. \n\nLong answer short, she loved the newest film! \n\nThanks for the question!"

Try to double the number of flights with each Earth-Mars orbital rendezvous, which is every 26 months, until the city can grow by itself.\n",
      "Unlikely",
      "At first, I was thinking we would just scale up Falcon Heavy, but it looks like it probably makes more sense just to have a single monster boost stage.",
      "I actually measured this with my phone! Almost exactly 6 hours on average. ",
      "There should definitely be a science mission to Europa",
      "Thrust to weight is optimizing for a surprisingly low thrust level, even when accounting for the added mass of plumbing and structure for many engines. Looks like a little over 230 metric tons (~500 klbf) of thrust per engine, but we will have a lot of them :)",
      "Mostly gravity. The center of gravity is pretty low for the booster, as all the engines and residual propellant is at the bottom.\n\nWe are going to weld steel shoes over the landing feet as a precautionary measure.",
      "Goal is 100 metric tons of useful payload to the surface of Mars. This obviously requires a very big spaceship and booster system.",
      "It used to be developing a new metal alloy that is extremely resistant to oxidation for the hot oxygen-rich turbopump, which is operating at insane pressure to feed a 300 bar main chamber. Anything that can burn, will burn. We seem to have that under control, as the Raptor turbopump didn't show erosion in the test firings, but there is still room for optimization.\n\nBiggest question right now is sealing the carbon fiber tanks against cryo propellant with hot autogenous pressurization. The oxygen tank also has an oxidation risk problem as it is pressurized with pure, hot oxygen. Will almost certainly need to apply an inert layer of some kind. Hopefully, something that can be sprayed. If need be, will use thin sheets of invar welded together on the inside.",
      "It had to be 42 for important scientific and fictional reasons! \n\nThe dense packing is just to max out thrust to weight, but it would be cool if there was a virtual nozzle side effect.",
      "Yeah, for those that know their stuff, that was really the big news :)\n\nThe flight tank will actually be slightly longer than the development tank shown, but the same diameter.\n\nThat was built with latest and greatest carbon fiber prepreg. In theory, it should hold cryogenic propellant without leaking and without a sealing linker. Early tests are promising.\n\nWill take it up to 2/3 of burst pressure on an ocean barge in the coming weeks.",
      "I think we need a new name. ITS just isn't working. I'm using BFR and BFS for the rocket and spaceship, which is fine internally, but...\n\nWill aim to release details of the habitation section when we have actual live mockups. Maybe in a year or two.",
      "Initially, glass panes with carbon fiber frames to build geodesic domes on the surface, plus a lot of miner/tunneling droids. With the latter, you can build out a huge amount of pressurized space for industrial operations and leave the glass domes for green living space.",
      "Actually, we could make the 2nd stage of Falcon reusable and still have significant payload on Falcon Heavy, but I think our engineering resources are better spent moving on to the Mars system.\n\nMCT will have meaningfully higher specific impulse engines: 380 vs 345 vac Isp. For those unfamiliar, in the rocket world, that is a super gigantic difference for stages of roughly equivalent mass ratio (mass full to mass empty).",
      "Not sure that we've really mastered anything yet. Maybe starting engines...",
      "yes",
      "The big booster will have an easier time of things than Falcon, as the mass ratio of the stages is lower and it will have lower density. Net result is that it won't come in quite as hot and fast as Falcon, so Falcon should be a bounding case on the big booster.\n\nFinal Falcon 9 has a lot of minor refinements that collectively are important, but uprated thrust and improved legs are the most significant.\n\nActually, I think the F9 boosters could be used almost indefinitely, so long as there is scheduled maintenance and careful inspections. Falcon 9 Block 5 -- the final version in the series -- is the one that has the most performance and is designed for easy reuse, so it just makes sense to focus on that long term and retire the earlier versions. Block 5 starts production in about 3 months and initial flight is in 6 to 8 months, so there isn't much point in ground testing Block 3 or 4 much beyond a few reflights.",
      "- Approx 360 sec vacuum Isp and 290 metric tons of thrust \n- A high acceleration landing is a lot more efficient, so there wouldn't be any hovering unless it encountered a problem or unexpected wind conditions. A rocket that lands slowly is wasting a lot of fuel.\n- Aiming for 20 g's\n",
      "Those are the header tanks that contain the landing propellant. They are separate in order to have greater insulation and minimize boil-off, avoid sloshing on entry and not have to press up the whole main tank.",
      "Default plan is to have a sea level and vacuum version of Raptor, much like Merlin. Since the booster and spaceship will both have multiple engines, we don't have to have fundamentally different designs. \n\nThis plan might change.",
      "With sub-cooled propellant, I think we can get the Falcon 9 upper stage mass ratio (excluding payload) to somewhere between 25 and 30. Another way of saying that is the upper stage would be close to 97% propellant by mass.",
      "Good question -- that wasn't shown at IAC. The spaceship and tanker would have split body flaps for pitch and roll. Probably just use the attitude control thrusters for yaw.\n",
      "Probably just pack the pressurized space with cargo. Early missions will be heavily weighted towards cargo. First crewed mission would have about a dozen people, as the goal will be to build out and troubleshoot the propellant plant and Mars Base Alpha power system.",
      "There is no meaningful limit. We would have to replace a few parts that experience thermal stress after 40 cycles, but the rest of the engine would be fine.",
      "The liquid oxygen transfer tube serves as the header tank for ox",
      "The spaceship would be limited to around 5 g's nominal, but able to take peak loads 2 to 3 times higher without breaking up.\n\nBooster would be nominal of 20 and maybe 30 to 40 without breaking up.",

      "This comes from Nate Wessler, an ACLU attorney who focuses on litigation and advocacy around surveillance and privacy issues:\n\nThe mosaic theory is the principle that law enforcement’s collection of large quantities of data about a person can trigger protections under the Fourth Amendment, even if the collection of small quantities of the same type of data wouldn’t. One example that has been before the Supreme Court is GPS tracking. In 2012, in United States v. Jones, the Supreme Court held that police need a search warrant to use a GPS device to track a suspect’s car. Although the Justices split on their reasoning, five members of the Court held that at least longer-term GPS tracking requires a warrant (about a month in that case), even if shorter durations of tracking wouldn’t. This reasoning recognizes that new surveillance technologies give the government unprecedented powers to amass large quantities of information about people at low cost, which requires careful judicial oversight. \n \nAs courts across the country have been struggling to ensure that the Fourth Amendment’s protections keep pace with the advance of technology, the mosaic theory has emerged as one effective tool. Cases involving cell phone location tracking, electronic medical records access, automated license plate readers, and other types of electronic surveillance are now or will soon be working their way through the courts.

It would require the government to be more transparent about its use of some surveillance authorities, but it would allow the FBI to keep secret some of the information the public needs most. And while it would end the bulk collection of call records under Section 215, it would leave the government with the authority to engage in the broad collection of other kinds of sensitive records. All of this said, the USA Freedom Act would at least be a step in the right direction, which is more than can be said for the straight reauthorization being proposed by the Republican leadership in the Senate.\"\n\nHere are some ways it could be improved: https://www.aclu.org/blog/washington-markup/its-congress-turn-what-meaningful-surveillance-reform-looks",

      "Thanks for your questions. The ACLU and other organizations advocating for protections against censorship online can – and do – work to make it clear to Congress that people care about these issues, and that censoring or limiting online speech will impoverish public debate and discourse. When Congress hears frequently from voters about an issue they care about, Congress tends to care about that issue as well. The ACLU also lobbies Congress on these issues directly.\n\nTo the extent that any policymaker is uninformed about technology policy issues (and many members of Congress are very knowledgeable about technology), the ACLU and other organizations can continue to work to raise awareness of those issues in the policymaking community. We can also work with technology companies to respond to policy proposals that are either based on misunderstandings about how technology works or would have unintended consequences for users’ privacy or free expression.\n",

      "There is very little doubt, in my mind, that what the next monumental achievement of humanity will be the first landing by an Earthling, a human being, on the planet Mars. And I expect that within 2 decades of the 5th anniversary of the first landing on the moon, that within 2 decades America will lead an international presence on Planet Mars. Some people may be rooting for Elon - I think he could, with his SpaceX, contribute considerably, enormously, to an international activity not only at the moon but also on Mars. I have considered whether a landing on Mars could be done by the private sector. It conflicts with my very strong idea, concept, conviction, that the first human beings to land on Mars should not come back to Earth. They should be the beginning of a build-up of a colony / settlement, I call it a \"permanence.\" A settlement you can visit once or twice, come back, and then decide you want to settle. Same with a colony. But you want it to be permanent from the get-go, from the very first. I know that many people don't feel that that should be done. Some people even consider it distinctly a suicide mission. Not me! Not at all. Because we will plan, we will construct from the moon of Mars, over a period of 6-7 years, the landing of different objects at the landing site that will be brought together to form a complete Mars habitat and laboratory, similar to what has been done at the Moon. Tourism trips to Mars and back are just not the appropriate way for human beings from Earth - to have an individual company, no matter how smart, send people to mars and bring them back, it is VERY very expensive. It delays the obtaining of permanence, internationally. Your question referred to a *monumental achievement by humanity* - that should not be one private company at all, it should be a collection of the best from all the countries on Earth, and the leader of the nation or the groups who makes a commitment to do that in 2 decades will be remembered throughout history, hundreds and thousands of years in the future of the history of humanity, beginning, commencing, a human occupation of the solar system. ",
      "My first words of my impression of being on the surface of the Moon that just came to my mind was *\"Magnificent desolation.*\" The magnificence of human beings, humanity, Planet Earth, maturing the technologies, imagination and courage to expand our capabilities beyond the next ocean, to dream about being on the Moon, and then taking advantage of increases in technology and carrying out that dream - achieving that is magnificent testimony to humanity. But it is also desolate - there is no place on earth as desolate as what I was viewing in those first moments on the Lunar Surface.\n\nBecause I realized what I was looking at, towards the horizon and in every direction, had not changed in *hundreds, thousands* of years. Beyond me I could see the moon curving away - no atmosphere, black sky. Cold. Colder than anyone could experience on Earth when the sun is up-  but when the sun is up for 14 days, it gets very, very hot. No sign of life whatsoever.\n\nThat is desolate. More desolate than any place on Earth. ",
      "*chuckle*\n\nBoth created considerable, favorable support of my activities. However, one involved the relationship between human beings, and the other a historic giant leap for mankind.\n\n",
      "I was open-minded in anticipation watching the earth grow smaller, the moon grow larger... but all of us were totally surprised when the larger moon totally eclipsed the sun.\n\nAnd we were in the shadow of the moon.\n\nSatisfactory photographs unfortunately were not produced.\n\nThe black sky was different, especially on the surface of the moon. Because from earth, the surrounding light is visible when looking at the night sky. In space, the sun is always affecting the night sky. But on the surface of the moon, the sun's light gave a pronounced velvet-like sheen, such that no stars were visible, especially in the vicinity of the earth. The stars were visible en route, but away from the sun, the stars were very visible, but on the surface of the moon, the ambient light enabled stars to be seen through the telescope but not through the visor cover on the eyes. \n",
      "To continue trying to fix the problem until the lack of oxygen caused us go to sleep. ",
      "*\"Where are the billions and billions and billions of people, on what I'm looking at? We're the only 3 that are not back there.\"*\n\nAnd we didn't get to celebrate. Because we were out of town. ",
      "I think it is expected to prepare significant leaders for all eventualities that might occur. As a member of the crew, we discussed ahead of time, before launch, the probabilities of successful landing, knowing the many things that would allow a successful return, and our nominal guess number was 60% success in landing, but throughout, an overall 95% of returning. \n\nAs is typical fighter pilots, the thoughts of non-overall success stimulated our preparation for the solution of all intermediate emergencies.\n\n",
      "Yes, they do. They recall (for me) the actual experience of myself in space - not by words, not by print, but visual reminders, it brings back a very in-depth appreciation. They can be used very well for communicating in speeches, talks, and more to other people who can actually see what i saw and what the camera saw. ",
      "I personally don't waste very much of my time on what is so obvious to a really thinking person, of all the evidence - we talked about Carl Sagan recently, who made a very prophetic observation. He said that \"extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence to make them believable.\" There is not extraordinary evidence of (as far as I know) all the claims that have been made that we did NOT go to the Moon. There are photographs from lunar reconnaissance orbiter satellites, going around the moon, that clearly show all of the experiments that we described when we came back from the moon, and they are evidence that we were there, telling the truth, you can even see a trail of Neil Armstrong's trek (not footprints really but the stirred up dust in walking or jogging behind him) to see the west Crater that we had flown over, that Neil was concerned about landing close to that - and he took photos of that and then he went back to the spacecraft. I was back inside the spacecraft at this time, but looking at the photos of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiters, you can clearly see the evidence of Neil's trek. And he took photographs, and all the signs are still there. Our flag in Apollo 11 was, without the doubt, the best looking flag that was stuck on the moon. But it was close to the spacecraft, so when we lifted off, Neil observed that the rocket exhaust caused the flag to strike the ground, to fall over. And by this time, I'm sure the radiation in space has deteriorated every piece of cloth on the flags, whether they are flying on the surface or standing up. We perhaps in the future will have very accurate rovers that can approach the different landing sites, and perhaps make available to people back on earth the ability to control a video scan, get out elevations, with floodlights to illuminate during the 14 days of darkness - I believe this will be very inspiring to people back here on earth, if we have the funds to do that, it would be great to do that.\n\nThe space suit had a soft interior to the shoes, and when the boots got put over the shoes, there is much cushioning effect, and the light weight due to the reduced gravity and the thickness of the dust, made it difficult to sense the feel of the surface. it was so remarkable, the way the bootprints were left, with such strong definition of the soil underneath, like moist talcum powder I guess, it keeps its shape, so I photographed before and after, pictures of the surface, and then I thought that looked a little lonely, so I put another bootprint down, and moved my foot a little bit so you could see my foot and the bootprint. \n\nI have since been told by a comic, by a humorist, what humor really is - but just as we were leaving the moon, I had given some thought to this, and I was able to create two achievements of humor in one sentence. \n\nWhen Mission Control said, to us, as we were about to leave \"Tranquility bass, you are cleared for liftoff,\" I responded by saying to them \"Roger, Houston, we are number one on the runway.\"\n\nThere wasn't anybody else for us to be 2, 3, 4 to! But there wasn't any runway up there either!\n\nIt's a phrase most pilots hear many times - \"Roger Tower, acknowledge we are number 3 for takeoff on the runway\" Because there are people waiting before us in an airplane to start take off. Pilots always get it. We are not going to roll ahead with increasing speed, we were going to lift off straight UP the way we left the earth!. ",
      "Well, 30 Rock means 30 Rockefeller Plaza. My father, in 1925, 1926, in the Reserve of the Air Corps, worked as Aviation Fuel Manager for Standard Oil of New Jersey, that's where I lived at that time, and he would go into NYC and work at 30 Rockefeller Plaza. So when I was asked to consider participating, I jumped for joy, and I can't remember a more pleasant episode of discussions with Tina Fey as we talked about her fictitious mother's (I think it was) love affair that she had with me, Buzz Aldrin. And then we looked at the Moon, and we both sort of cursed at it for various reasons and said - I'll never forget the line - \"I walked on your FACE!\"",
      "I have watched many movies from martians coming to Earth in New Jersey in the form of giant snakes - this was a radio program created by Orson Welles, War of the Worlds - and I've read many science fiction stories, descriptions, by Isaac Asimov, but my favorite of course is Arthur C. Clarke. So 2001: A Space Odyssey. And then later on, I managed to arrange a cruise ship departing from Sri Lanka where Clarke lived, and I was able to stay with him, talking about many, many things in the past. I wrote a book along with Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins, called First on the Moon, and the epilogue was written by Arthur C. Clarke. When I wrote *my* book of science fiction, Arthur C. Clarke wrote a one page forward that was OUTSTANDING, absolutely, as he praised our ingenuity and imagination. And when we visited, we talked about a treasure he had discovered in the ocean, and we both hoped in the future that he and I could scuba dive and perhaps retrieve some of that treasure. That never happened, unfortunately.\n\n I thought that the movie Gravity, the depiction of people moving around in zero gravity, was really the best I have seen. The free-falling, the actions that took place between two people, were very, I think, exaggerated, but probably bent the laws of physics. But to a person who's been in space, we would cringe looking at something that we hoped would NEVER, EVER Happen. It's very thrilling for the person who's never been there, because it portrays the hazards, the dangers that could come about if things begin to go wrong, and I think that as I came out of that movie, I said to myself and others, \"Sandra Bullock deserves an Oscar.\"",
      "Back in the 60's and 70's when we were achieving in competition with the Soviet Union, but also to stimulate the United States to improve its technologies and science, we (the United States) won clearly the race (if you want to call it that) to the Moon. And I believe that that demonstration of the perseverance, the dedication, the depth of the industrial capacity of the United States went a long ways to convince Premier Gorbachev that the Soviet Union could not match - the announcement by President Reagan that we would develop a strategic defense initiative, branded by the media in a detrimental way, as \"Star Wars\" - it, I believe, was a major factor in the ending of the Cold War and the separation of the Satellite Nations around the U.S.S.R. It gave us peace. It reduced the Nuclear Weapon threat worldwide. \n\nSo we are now very interested in science, technology, engineering and math. When we went to the moon and thereafter shortly, we were number one, and I think that there are many children's books  - I have written 2 so far, and I have another one that is well underway on National Geographic that follows my adult book, Mission to Mars and my vision for space exploration. I think that reading to children will help inspire that interest in aerospace, and many other supporting career fields. Not everyone can be an astronaut and go into space, some people with sufficient resources can purchase and fly sub-orbitally thanks to various companies and for more money (considerably) fly into orbit. For a million dollars, the Russians would take two people, a million apiece, around the moon and back. However, stories, videos that come from the space station, and other people, are a great inspiration to young people for an exciting career field. ",
      "On Apollo 11 in route to the Moon, I observed a light out the window that appeared to be moving alongside us. There were many explanations of what that could be, other than another spacecraft from another country or another world - it was either the rocket we had separated from, or the 4 panels that moved away when we extracted the lander from the rocket and we were nose to nose with the two spacecraft. So in the close vicinity, moving away, were 4 panels. And i feel absolutely convinced that we were looking at the sun reflected off of one of these panels. Which one? I don't know. So technically, the definition could be \"unidentified.\"\n\nWe well understood exactly what that was. And when we returned, we debriefed and explained exactly what we had observed. And I felt that this had been distributed to the outside world, the outside audience, and apparently it wasn't, and so many years later, I had the time in an interview to disclose these observations, on another country's television network. And the UFO people in the United States were very very angry with me, that i had not given them the information. It was not an alien. Extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence. That's what Carl Sagan said. There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. The probability is almost CERTAIN that there is life somewhere in space. It was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today. \n\nBut the distances involved in where some evidence of life may be, they may be hundreds of light years away.

      "As Carl Sagan noted, \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\"  Personally, I strongly believe life forms exist with some abundance throughout the universe. But the tremendous distances involved in the immenseness of the universe make discovery problematic in the near future, and visits by either us or them extremely improbable. ",

      "I believe it was after leaving the surface of the moon and completing a successful rendezvous with Mike Collins in the command module, as we approached connecting / docking, the procedures in the checklist said one thing, and I thought maybe doing it a slightly different way, rolling and pitching instead of something else, and I thought that was better on the spur of the moment! It turns out that it was not a good thing to do, because it caused the platform to become locked, and we were not able to use the primary thrusters, the primary guidance, to control the spacecraft, to its final few feet to dock and join the other spacecraft. That was my mistake. I suggested to my commander that we do it differently, and it was his mistake to assume that i knew what I was talking about. So we both made mistakes - brought about by me! We recovered successfully on the \"abort guidance\" system. \n\n(I don't admit that to many people)\n\n(but I'm sure the mission controllers in Houston, while it was happening or certainly afterwards, they certainly knew what had happened, but fortunately they didn't squeal on us)",
      "On the Gemini mission in space, on my doctoral thesis at MIT, those techniques were used by Gemini, Apollo and even the space shuttle. But I was very disappointed when it looked like I wouldn't even have a chance to fly in the two-man Gemini program! I was not scheduled to be anything other than the back up crew. A tragedy changed that, and I was a backup pilot on Gemini 9, and then I would be on the primary crew for Gemini 12, the final mission. The #1 air force experiment was on Gemini 9 and 12, but its use was unsuccessful on Gemini 9, and so I became the first astronaut to train underwater in neutral buoyancy. I had been a scuba diver 10 years earlier, and knew that training underwater would be very very effective, and I felt very confident of carrying out the difficult procedures to be able to free-maneuver outside the spacecraft with the equipment (this is what George Clooney's character was doing with the jetpack in Gravity) - unfortunately NASA cancelled that experiment.

      "Drive over to the nearest airport, and enroll in flight classes. You will experience the joy of freedom in the air above, as you study the mechanics of how this is made possible by understanding the construction, the laws of motion, the air that can provide lift when it is moved by propulsion through the air, and stay above the gravity pulling the airplane back down to earth.

      "The mobility was limited by the flexibility of the suit, and its operation in 1/6 gravity simulation in neutral buoyancy created too much viscous drag. Actual mobility was quite easier than anticipated. ",
      "Yes, I did. I met Carl Sagan and his wife. Both were very dedicated people to explaining to young people and to all people the benefits to be derived from space, the history of how our universe was formed, and the history of the advancement of the technologies that hundreds of years ago, enabled present day nations to use them to begin to add more science discoveries in space. And to write stories and television series that reach many people and after his passing away, you have a rejuvenation of the series COSMOS, featuring a very good friend of mine, Neil deGrasse Tyson. We were on a commission together to look at the future of space activities for the United States, that was about 12 years ago, and we've been good friends ever since. I was on his TV show. He did Michael Jackson's moonwalk far better than I did on Dancing With the Stars. ",
      "No... It was many years ago, I think there was a game called Buzz Aldrin's Adventures in Space, something like that - it was a simplified precursor. The eagerly anticipated Space Program Manager, planning future international human activities on the moon and future US-led activities on Mars leading to permanence on the surface, has yet to come. ",
      "We in the United States cannot come close to the return to leadership that the United States had 45 years ago, and shortly thereafter. The lack of funding that supported missions to the Moon and return, a pioneering effort for humanity, required 4% of the national budget of the United States. Now we are at 1/2 of 1% and have been that way for quite some while. To those of us that feel that America is a leader, it was, we helped win WWI, WWII, the Cold War, and we can lead the other nations in peace, just the way that the plaque on the moon that Neil and I left, \"We came in peace for all Mankind\" - I believe that that is so American, to do things, and share with other nations of the world. That's how we should go back to the Moon, not by competing with other nations, like China, to land our people - we've *done* that. The robotics, the operation of rovers and such at a great distance, has improved tremendously in the last 45 years. I don't believe the human mind has increased that much at all. So let the other nations of the world put their citizens on the surface of the moon for prestige - that is a major reason why nations put their people on the Moon. But we've done that, we can help the other nations, and we can help other nations use our facilities, and then we can deploy a radio telescope on Mars via balloon and design a strong suggestion for what the lunar base should be, on the near side & the far side, we can help in the construction of those elements, and we can bring those elements that are landed by other countries (because they are heavy, expensive) - we can bring them together and then the interface between elements that will come together in a complicated way because this is in a gravity field with uneven terrain, it's not as simple as the space shuttle docking with the space station, or any spacecraft, and zero gravity, it's much much more difficult, it requires (from a distance) bringing them sufficiently close and aligning them so that the two interfaces from adjacent cylinders (that may be 20 feet in diameter, 30 feet long, vertically part of the the shared space onboard the base) and from each one of these 3 can emanate 2 different nations for a total of 6 different individual nations growing outward for their habitation and laboratories and to control robots on the surface, to establish a distinct presence and yet sharing with the other people who have their personnel and their astronauts or the front or back side. But that is the great contribution of the United States, technically, but it's not a contribution that requires great investment of money for big rockets, and sustaining people on the surface. \n\nReturning to the Moon with NASA astronauts is not the best usage of our resources. Because OUR resources should be directed to outward, beyond-the-moon, to establishing habitation and laboratories on the surface of Mars that can be built, assembled, from the close-by moons of Mars. With very little time delay - a second or less. Much better than controlling things on the Moon from the Earth. So when NASA funding comes up for review, please call your lawmakers to support it. ",
      "I was very close to the top of my class at West Point. And I continued to expand my understanding of the world around me, and the human evolutions here on earth, the achievements perhaps to other people are impressive when I tell them that not only have I been to the North Pole, I haven't been to the South Pole yet, but I have been to the Titanic in a little yellow french submarine. It took an hour and a half just to sink down in the ocean about 2 miles deep to look out the thick glass window and see the Titanic. The visibility was such that we could see the bow, it became very famous in the movie thanks to James Cameron, but the visibility was not so good that you could actually see the bottom of the ocean that the Titanic was resting on. So it was an eerie site, of a ship festooned with rusting metal, like gingerbread. Floating, floating out the window in the Ocean. ",

      "Well, personally, I'm personally involved in evolving the special orbital dynamics that facilitate transporting humans between Earth and Mars. It's called cycling orbits. And the next would be - I'm not involved in but very interested - and that is permanent occupation on the surface of Mars. And rotating crews permanently on the lunar surface. \n\nI have a particular interest in Moon Express because my younger son is the president!  I am hoping we can develop the large fuel capacity of their spacecraft to depart earth and head at Mars on July 4th, 2019, and land on the moon Phobos. That's the 50th anniversary of the first landing on the Moon, and to demonstrate a private enterprise moon landing, to be able to be a precursor demonstration during a significant historical anniversary, might be used to commit to American-led permanence on Mars within 2 decades. The Moon Express is a non-human mission, of course, but it is leading the way. I think that time exploring and further investigative missions of Mars might stimulate human occupation and return. Human occupation, lengthy surveys of essential landing sites, and returns. This might include a non-human but very humanlike robot that needs to be fed - probably oil, haha! And electricity. \n\n",

But it was the challenge and competition, why did the competition fail, what were the significant changes that made the final well-managed program successful... there will always be refinements in retrospect that should promote satisfaction in the game-player, that actually would be useful in future exploration. \n\nI hope the game will be translated into Chinese and other international languages, as the US in the future does not compete but rather works with all other nations in their advancements in the same subjects: **s**cience, **t**echnology, **e**ngineering, **a**rt, and **m**athematics.

      "I felt that there was an obligation on my part to put forth the reasons why a commander who had been burdened down with an enormous amount of responsibility and training for activities (and because of that, in all previous missions, if someone, a crew member, was to spacewalk, it was always the junior person, not the space commander who would stay inside). We knew this would be different because 2 people would be going out. There was a group at NASA who felt the junior person (me) should go out first, but many people felt the great symbology of the commander from past expeditions or arrivals at a destination. The decision that was made was absolutely correct as far as who went out first, symbolically. However who was in charge of the what happened after both people are outside, I believe, could have been done differently. I was not the commander, I was a junior person, so once both were outside, I followed my leader, because we (NASA) had not put together detailed jobs of people outside. I believe it could have been improved. But it was very successful for what it was. And the decision wasn't up to me, or Neil, it was up to people much higher up in NASA. ",

I participated with great honor in becoming one of the first to land on the moon, and now I am devoting and have devoted many years of my life to enabling Americans to lead international nations to permanence on the planet Mars.

      "I think it has been very selected and prepared for long duration trips in a partial atmosphere and in zero gravity, where a can of peas or rice or whatever would pretty soon be all over the cabin! In the Simpsons I played a role where I opened a bag of popcorn and it was all over the place. Bart Simpson said \"no no no! don't open that!\" The taste was generally pleasant. But it was mostly freeze-dried so we had to add water to the container and let it set - and around the instrument panel and other parts of the spacecraft, we had certain places we had velcro so we could attach things so we wouldn't have to hold onto each one or have it float around the cabin. We had to use a water gun to send water into the plastic bag with the freeze-dried food. Now later on, things got much better and they were more like TV dinners that I remember - I don't see too many these days - as long as the food has some stickiness to it, it won't float around, but if it is like M&Ms, that are used in training with zero gravity, they're all over the place, and so would water form into spheres and float around in the cabin! So the crewman has to be very careful about adjusting to a lack of gravity sensation. We had *very* small shrimp that had a little bit of cocktail sauce, and when exposed to water, were very very tasty. But you wouldn't want a shrimp an inch long floating around the cabin!",
      "Well, I realized that before the mission, and wanted the symbolism in the form of our mission to include the national, worldwide pledge for advancement. But I was fully satisfied approaching a landing on the moon, especially when training personnel suggested the eagle carry the olive branch of peace. Following a successful landing, a personal gesture of thanks was achieved by the limited spiritual sacrament of personal communion - I asked people of the world to give thanks in their own way. And my way was with a symbolic wafer. ",
      "I haven't met him yet!",
      "Yes. \n\nI realized that unfortunate things may occur, anytime, to anyone, just as disastrous events may occur - to pilots, to combat pilots, or to those in space. To appropriately respond to an emergency requires a very clear mind, to cooly analyze what the observations are and how to fix it. Fear and worry are emotions that cloud the mind from being able to think clearly, to remember what the procedures are to deal with that emergency. Dwelling on an engine failure for a pilot as he rolls down the runway is NOT what he should be thinking about - it's obtaining a smooth liftoff! But in the back of his mind, he knows *exactly* what to do (or pretty much) and in many cases, if he's alone in the fighter aircraft, he has to leave that aircraft in an ejection seat in a big hurry! \n\nWhen I am getting ready to cross a street, I look both ways before crossing. My bones, my muscles, are not what they used to be, so I am careful when I go up and down stairs, because I've heard stories of older people falling and having very disabling injuries. I have enough things that begin to go a little bit wrong as I get a little bit older. I'd just as soon not have major catastrophes to have to deal with. So I very carefully move around, avoiding dangerous situations. ",
      "Well, I hope the latter is true! \n\nBut for the reason that to prevent failures, that instead avoid short-term political and other causes that produce short-range objectives, such as the M (Asteroid Retrieval Mission), and the heritage component (old stuff), mandated by politically-motivated Congressional laws. \n\nSimilarly, absurdly, policies such as forbidding NASA employees to speak to Chinese space personnel instead of the U.S. instituting a Chinese cooperation in LEO (Low Earth Orbit) and beyond, for human missions for peaceful purposes.",

      "Very good training for him! Enjoyable and welcome publicity for me. ",
      "My intellect now, having been there, and developed, and thought about humans going to Mars, has been so intense and so very useful to the future, I think I need to continue to think and plan and marry all of the different things that we could do that make transportation in space from the earth to the space station, from the earth to the moon to space stations around the moon to visiting an asteroid, which the President said we should do - when he observed in 2010 in his first term that humans should visit an asteroid by 2025. And I believe we should do that again, but we should have a robot slowly conserving fuel, so that in 1, or 2 years, get there just after a crew has arrived on the same asteroids. Combining those 2 without a human being, and with a human being, each has significant limitations but when those are put together, on the same asteroid, you are able to do much, much more for that mission in 2025, or 2026, or 2027, than the present mission that NASA and some of Congress and some of the President's office feel. So no - because I am needed here on earth to focus on opening up these opportunities, and also because the budget would not be there.",
      "We didn't jettison the parachutes soon enough, so the impact on the water moved my fingers away from the circuit breakers, which had to be pushed in before Mike Collins, throwing the switch to jettison the parachutes, could take place! So the parachutes pulled us over, and allowed the spacecraft to float upside-down rather than right side up. Now the engineers were very surprised in the early testing of the spacecraft in water to discover that it would float upside-down as well as right-side up. So they devised a system of inflating big balloons that would then turn the spacecraft right-side up. We had to do that. ",
      "I had 2 re-entries: one in 1966 and one in 1969. In 1966, it was the last reentry in the 2-person Kennedy program. So I held a camera up against the window to film the flames from the heat shield that was behind us, but foremost in the spacecraft, and the flames were going backwards, away from us, in the front, and I was holding the camera and taking photographs. The g-forces increased and I wasn't able to continue to hold the camera against the window, so I had to lay it back against my chest, but still continued to photograph the re-entry until there was no more unusual visual effects of the energy in the atmosphere. And it was very comforting to understand that the people in Houston, the controllers, had very high confidence that we were on the right path. And the right path means that as you enter the atmosphere, the lift of the spacecraft is down to be able to capture the trajectory from the moon, and once that is assured, that the spacecraft won't skip out, we now roll the spacecraft so the lift vector is up,  it's predicted by the computer, as basically a target, moving it up to where it now was exactly where we wanted it to be, and then we could roll the spacecraft so that it no longer had increasing lift in any direction but had zero lift, effectively, and we would guide it down to a point where we could then deploy automatically a device that would slow us down enough that then at 10,000 feet, the 3 parachutes would come out, a little lower the pressure of the atmosphere outside was greater than inside, and we could smell the salt air and it was very encouraging to return to earth.

      "Yes, it was challenging to understand what was necessary to successfully carry out all the training simulations that we, as crewmen, would  experience, and make a very successful use of that training and education.

From what I see the properties of both plastics are used in concert to stop the bullet by spreading it's energy as widely as possible. The acrylic layers shatter, they spread a lot of energy. I can see the widest shockwave from my slug is in the centermost layer. But the polycarb layers don't shatter, they streeetch, (and I think) harnessing the energy spreading outwards from the acrylic layers. The shockrings produced by the stretching laminate layers is super cool. I've got a photo somewhere...\n\n",

IN fact you can see details from my model there all over the Obiwan/Jango fight scene on the landing platform. They used my model as background for that whole scene. Awesome seeing my work blown up (and holding it's scale) across a big movie screen. Still gives me chills. I had a rough sketch to work from but got to make up all the detailing as I saw fit.

And that’s about it, I’ve got a cold right now, so I’m drinking a lot of tea, but after noon it’ll all be Throat Coat (which, by the way, is the greatest tea if you have a cold) \n\n\nAs far as my energy, my parents always encouraged me to make stuff. They both gave me an example of a life lived doing the thing you want to do. Both my dad and mom had careers they were very invested in. I was very lucky to see that. They supported me in finding my way. By that I mean they helped me pay my rent when I quit a job I didn’t like; that’s a tremendous privilege they gave to me. I am incredibly grateful for it, and that allowed me to find my place in the world, which didn’t really happen until I moved to San Francisco in the early 90s. By then I sort of found things that I was excellent at, like building and problem solving, and I was able to push those into careers. And when you push the thing you’re really good at into a career it does feel like work, because it’s really hard work to do something well, but it also doesn’t drain you at the end of the day. It’s self-generating. And now with the 13 years of MythBusters (where the best plots were where Jamie and I had the most enthusiasm, and Kari, Grant, and Tory) the best episodes were the ones that we were the most invested in. Our job was effectively to find the thing we were thrilled by and put everything we had into it. \n\n\nSo again, that’s energy generating. I am always looking for things that I find interesting and trying to dive into them. That’s just part of my makeup. \n\n\nI don’t know if that’s exactly an answer to your question, but it’s sort of an answer to why I keep on doing six different things at once and why it seems to be working right now. \n",

I totally understood why. The episode changed all of our safety procedures, strengthened them, like any wake-up-call should.

      "Here I am. I just read this, and I seriously doubt it's veracity. I'm sure someone is carefully explicating this somewhere else in this thread, but for the record: \nThe resistance of air is 10k volts per centimeter (give or take). That means that if you have a wire with 10,000 volts in it trying to get somewhere, and you bring a grounded wire up to it, it won't make that leap across (called a spark) until the grounded wire is 1cm away. Again, give or take. \nSo think about static shocks you've gotten over the years. I'm sure you've actually at some point seen a spark from static electricity, right? Even seen it jump across air? Maybe something like 1/2 an inch? Given the above formula that's a static spark that's in excess of 10k volts. \n\nWe showed on MB that it's relatively easy (with the right fabrics etc) for someone to generate well in excess of 20k volts just moving around on a fabric car seat of the right material, while wearing clothing that aided and abetted the storing of static electricity. Static sparks are far higher in voltage than most people realize. 40k is on the high end from what I've researched, but not so far out of the realm of reasonable as the article would have us believe.\n\nBut as for setting fire to a carpet because of a 'perfect storm\" of static electricity gathering? Maybe if the carpet had just been cleaned with gasoline, but I'm dubious. \n\nOh, and by the way, it just made our master list. \n\nAnd by the way again, electricity myths are a pain in the ass. You can't see it, reading it can be difficult, people don't smoke and spark when they get electrocuted and you can't shoot a whole episode simply staring at values on an LCD meter. You have to actually DO something with the electricity that's televisual. Something that, in our experience, is a pain in the ass. \n\nThat is all for now. I am not a scientist, I play one on TV. Some of my data above may be off, or wrong, and I'll take correction with a good humor, because that happens a lot. I stand by the basic gist of what i'm saying. \n\nThat is all.",
      "We are not doing science on this show. Science requires rigorous re-checking of results and many iterations to make sure ones results are free from bias.

We also demonstrate that science is a deeply creative field, that is messy and full of wrong turns. Making this show has turned me into a scientist: it's fundamentally altered my way of thinking. So I defend the show as scientific. I like to say that we don't necessarily stand behind our results (because of the confines of concision and making a tv show etc) but we stand 100% behind our methodologies. If we turn out to have screwed up a methodology we  will go back and re-test it. THAT is the most scientific thing we do: change our minds based on better evidence. ",

Obviously, even within scientific confines, it’s really difficult to do, which is why we repeat experiments and why conclusions are so difficult to come to. And why facts are so rare.\n\nBut when you’re talking about an object truth, you’re in the opposite universe than politics exists in, because politics are all about relative truth.  “I’m speaking this truth to this group, I’m speaking that truth to that group” … “I want everyone to vote for me, so I’m going to lie to everybody.”\n\n*sigh*\n\nWhich is why I love Bernie so much, because I feel like he gives really consistent answers to everybody, it just sounds simple when he talks.

It might not be the truth, but it’s the truth as he’s thinking about it. And he even seems to me like someone who’d change his mind if you brought him evidence to the contrary of something he firmly believes. \n\nSo, I know you didn’t ask me who I liked, but I don’t think you have to look very deeply into my history to figure out that Bernie would be my guy.",

      "This is one of the most common questions. What myth did we want to do that the production wouldn't let us do? For the most part if we really wanted to do something, Discovery stood behind it. I might have answered this in another AMA, but I'll tell you there are three. There's one about a truck full of liquid oxygen that spills on a road bed and turns the entire road into a bomb. We played enough with liquid oxygen to respect its power and understand that it is some of the scariest stuff on earth. It can literally turn an oily rag into a bomb, and that's not exaggeration. It's terrifying. And to deal with an entire truck load on a road that might explode (or to be honest if we're gonna spend that much money, it has to explode one way or another) what we found was it was dangerous and unpredictable, and that made going full scale really really touchy, so we decided to leave that one. \n\nAnother one is upside down race car. But no one stood in our way of doing upside down race car. I should explain. Upside down race car is the myth that a formula one or indycar (two different kinds of cars, I'm totally aware of that) has so much down force because of its construction that it could drive upside down and still hug the road. We've been wanting to do this since season one. And number one, obviously we can't do it full scale with a road. We're not going to build a tunnel. That's hundreds of thousands of dollars, that's well more than the budget for an episode of MythBusters. We could do it potentially in a wind tunnel, but we could not find either a wind tunnel that would go fast enough, or two someone that would lend us their indycar or formula one car and allow us to hang it upside down in said wind tunnel. If said wind tunnel actually existed, be assured that it would cost in excess of $10,000 an hour to operate, and that right there also pushes us way to the outside edge of the MythBusters budget. \n\nLastly, there is an episode that we were going to do in the last season, but we didn't have time to complete, and so I had to let it go. It's a Native American myth, supposedly, that if you wanted to go duck hunting, you would float pumpkins in a pond that the ducks frequented and get them used to pumpkins floating around them. Then when you were hungry and wanted duck for dinner, you would put a pumpkin on your head and swim over to the duck that looked, I guess the tastiest, and the duck would not notice you because you're just a floating pumpkin. And then according to a hunter friend of mine you could reach out and pull the duck right under. Now we weren't gonna pull the duck under on camera, or at all because of, you know, cruelty to animals. But I did want to find out if I could swim up to a duck dressed as a pumpkin and capture it, because that would be amazing! Unfortunately, a couple of the episodes in our last season ended up being so difficult to shoot that we put those difficulties into the narratives, and thus we ended up with narratives that were fat enough we didn't need this secondary story. Pumpkin duck hunting was always going to be about a 12-13 minute story, not a very long one. And like I said, we ended up with enough narrative that we didn't need that, so I took one for the team and chucked it. So I'll never get to know. Maybe someday I'll get to know, but not on MythBusters.\n",

      "The squeaky ducks from the duck bomb video are still in my shop. I have not bombed anyone unwittingly. That is sort of because I don't like pranking people. I know that seems kind of weird, but my inclination is to not prank people. It's simply because it’s very hard to prank people nicely. Now a duck bomb isn't necessarily a bad prank, it's not because I think duck bombing is bad per se, it's just I don't think towards pranking in general.\n\n\nBut, I'm fully aware they are pelicans not ducks. That same company makes pink flamingos, they make pelicans and they make a couple others, but really the pelicans are by far the best. they have the most plaintive cry of all of those screaming, rubberized animals.

      "Did I think the show would be as popular as it eventually became? Absolutely not. I mean, again this wasn't my concept. I came to this show as hired talent in the beginning and figured out my job on the fly, and my understanding of what that job was changed over the years. But because I came from behind the scenes, I mean I have some acting and performance training in my deep background as a high school student, but as a film crew member--model maker, rigger, all that stuff--I know that the rule of entertainment is that it's super fickle and the bottom can drop out any second. So every year that they renewed MythBusters for the first five or six years, I was like \"Really?! Cool!\" and we'd get another year to do this.  In the middle there, the middle few years, I was like \"Okay, you know, I feel like we can pretty much expect another year, that's great.\" and then at this point it felt like I'm not sure they're gonna renew it another year, that's when we worked with Discovery to shoot this final season. \n\nSo, never expected it to do as well. Never expected that we would become part of the cultural lexicon. We never intended to make a show that was educational for kids, that was fun to watch for the whole family. Seriously, none of that was on our radar. We were just telling stories of a couple of guys satisfying their curiosity in as rigorous a fashion as we could achieve within the confines of making a television show. The idea that I would then learn deeply about how creative the scientific method was, and how to tell stories about building rigorous methodologies is not something I ever expected. I'm astonished by how far and wide and deep MythBusters has gone around the world and in our culture and in me.\n\nI've never thought we were done testing myths. At the end of the first three pilots we shot in the summer of 2002, Jamie called me up about a week later and was like \"So that was fun\" and I was like \"Yea!\" He's like \"I don't know really where it could go. I mean, I think we pretty much did everything. Do you want this Impala?\" which is the Impala we used for rocket car, and I was like \"I can't store it, I don't have a garage,\" and he was like \"Alright, I'm gonna sell it. Well...talk to you later.\" and then we hung up. We didn't talk again really until after the show aired, which was January of 2003, and then Discovery awarded the show, I think less than two weeks later. It was amazing how quick it was. And again, I think we were talking at some point and Jamie was like \"I don't know what we're going to do because I think we've sort of answered everything.\" And it wasn't like I had this long list of things that I thought that we were gonna do, but we had no idea where we were gonna go. We didn't realize that film was going to provide all these wonderful movie stunt physics that we could test. Social media really didn't have a whole other world at the beginning. Things like Facebook or Twitter or Reddit weren't extant back then and part of the popular culture. Viral videos weren't a thing, and that's a massive amount of stories that we did. So that sort of gives you an idea about how the narratives that we built changed over the years. \n\nMy thoughts about staring down the inevitable end of MythBusters have gone through many stages. All of the stages of dealing with death, I would think. Anger, denial, bargaining, acceptance, etc. and I owe a great amount of thanks to Paget Brewster. Paget is a friend/acquaintance of mine through the Thrilling Adventure Hour theater players. In January of last year we were doing a thing here in San Francisco as part of San Francisco Sketchfest, and Paget said to me \"Oh, sweetie, your show is going to end in a year? You better get ready, because it's really going to fuck you up.\" And I was like \"Seriously? What?\" and she was like \"Yea, I was on my show for 6 years.\" She was on CSI for 6 years, and she was like \"When that ended, I found it really destabilizing and intense, and just when you've been doing the same thing for this long, get ready. It's going to affect you in all these ways you're not planning for.\" \n\nAnd it was a great gift that she gave me by telling me that was coming down the pipe. Because we started the last season, and it wasn't like we felt super elegiac about MythBusters ending at that point, and it wasn't until really--that was January we started filming that season--it wasn't really until September that the light at the end of the tunnel was clear, like \"Wow, we've only got like 9 weeks left.\" \"8 weeks left\" \"7 weeks left\". And thing that made me most sad is that I realized that I wasn't going to be making this show with these people. The MythBusters crew is the best working reality television crew in television. I'm not exaggerating, and I won't even qualify it. Those guys are incredible. They're my family, and we all effectively grew up together. Many of our people started off like a farm team of researchers and runners, and became producers and directors of photography, and became the best at those jobs. And looking around and realizing that this was the last time that I was going to be showing up on set every day and making up how to make this show every day with these amazing people, that's the part that I found the most difficult and the saddest. \n\nYou know, when I finally got back from our stage tour in December of 2015 and settled into the holidays, and then post-holidays when I settled into my unemployment, that affected me in a totally different way. It helped me understand how deeply I had identified with being \"the guy with the television show.\" and now I'm not the guy with the television show, and that's fine. It's just hard to see how much you attach your identification with the thing that you're doing until you're not doing it. And even though I was ready, I was like \"I'm ready, I'm ready for life without this show, ready to see what it’s like, ready to deal with the difficulties.” It doesn't even help knowing that the difficulties are coming. It's still difficult. It's still difficult because transition is tough. I mean if there is one thing about humans that's constant it's that we hate change. And it's weird because we seek it, we love change, and yet it's always destabilizing. I mean some people love it, I get it. Some people are going to post and go \"I love change!\" I get it. But I think most of us find moving our houses difficult. Changing jobs difficult. The things that we do and the ways in which we live our daily lives, they really do help us define ourselves to ourselves. And when those change, it starts to help illuminate the fact that our personalities are completely illusions. And it's a pervasive illusion, but it’s an illusion all the less. There, I just got Buddhist on your ass. \n\nI think Buster's fist on the rocket sled was cast urethane rubber. And as for how many whacks of the champagne bottle, I think it took four or five. Which if there's several cut into the show, that's how many it took. We're not gonna cut any of those out because it's nothing but hilarious that it takes a while to smash a bottle over Buster's hard head.\n\nEdit: Fixed the year, thanks! ",

      "I love this question because my first answer is… don’t ask a white dude. Don’t ask me! Ask them! \n\nGirls are the most natural, critical thinking scientists there are. The trick is to normalize for everybody that they can manipulate their world. That they can actually have an effect upon it. \n\nIt was natural for me to want to take things apart when I was a kid. My parents kind of encouraged that; they gave me old stuff to take apart. When you take apart enough things, how they go back together becomes kind of clear to you. Every kid is different, I have two boys and my thing is: they don’t necessarily have to be makers, but I’d like them to know how manipulatable the world. Part of that is when they’re enthusiastic about something, I put it in front of them. That’s really important because that’s what my parents did for me and that’s exactly the kind of way I want to privilege my kids’ enthusiasm.\n\nIf they’re interested in making anything, go ahead and take them to a class to do that. My mom took me to tons of summer classes in pottery and woodworking - stuff like that. There was a community center near my house in Westchester, New York, that had summer classes and I went and took them all the time. There was a woman who gave art classes in my neighborhood and my parents sent me to that art class. So, it’s like it might not even be that they end up becoming makers, but send them to classes in which they make things with their hands. If there’s any proclivity at all, that’s where they’ll find it. ",

But CAD/CAM (the drawing of something in 3D and then the translation of that into some machine language that outputs out of your 3D printer, laser cutter, whatever) still sucks. Everyone knows that it sucks. Translating something from your head out onto a screen in 2D so it can become 3D is still really, really difficult. There are a lot of people doing amazing work on it. I love what AutoDesk is doing in that they’re trying to make it more intuitive. And when that worm turns, when CAD/CAM becomes genuinely, naturally intuitive, that’s when I think things are going to get genuinely exciting. \n\n\nRight now the 3D output tends to be rough for consumer level machines (it’s getting finer and finer; we’re covering a lot of that on Tested.com) but these two paths of both the output being refined more and using recycled materials is really exciting, alongside the translation from people’s brains into their computer out to the machine; that’s really thrilling. \n\n\nI think that when kids can see something that they want to make, and they invest themselves in wanting to make it extant (my whole life has been spent doing this: thinking something in my brain and putting it in my hands) when a kid can see that that can happen, it wakes up this whole other portion of possibility for them. \n\n\nThat’s a world that should be open to every kid.

Here's something you didn't know about me: In 1919 my grandfather, who was a pilot in world war one was on a bender with his best friend in New York City, and at 5am they were in Washington Square Park drunk as skunks, fat with cash from having left the war, and apparently according to my dad, my grandfather's best friend Pare Lorentz, Pare and my grandfather bribed 2 milk truck drivers--and at this point milk was still delivered in a horse drawn carriage--bribed 2 milk truck drivers 5 bucks each, which in 1918/1919 was a lot of money--and they had a chariot race up 5th avenue in a pair of milk trucks while drunk. How about that? \n\nI mentioned the full name of my grandfather's best friend because Pare Lorentz was actually a really important new deal filmmaker and did a lot of films for Franklin Delano Roosevelt about the depression and about the dust bowl in particular, and along with his composer, Virgil Thompson, was a really important early american documentarian filmmaker.\n",

Each one is a different project that I'm working on, or a different mindset that I'm thinking about, and I'm able when I have an idea to pick it up and put it in the notebook it belongs in. I used to buy these think notebooks, you know, like 3/4 of an inch thick, like the moleskins and stuff. My problem with those is I would fill the first 50 pages and then stuff would be so jumbled I'd never be going back to it because it would be like, one page is a build I want to do, and another page is a movie idea i've got, or some sort of narrative, it's all over the place. This allows me a nice granular attack on each project so that when I open it up, there's all my thoughts within this one thing. But the perfect notebook, I have not yet found it. My guess is though, when I do, it will be under $30. Look, maybe I'll have to make it. That's also possible.",

It was a real grind, especially because working in the Mojave desert in 105 degrees; just not easy to work under those conditions. \n\nStories that seemed like they were going to be tough but turned out to be really fun? Nah, you know - we started every episode with “I can’t wait to get our hands on this”. I loved where the vacuum cleaner car lift ended up, that was awesome that it didn’t work the first time.

It's true that what defines the lethal zone is a combination of the blast pressure wave (which will tear your internals to shreds microscopically) and the shrapnel (which will tear your internals apart macroscopically), but again, without knowing the particulars of what explosive and how much, it's like asking \"How strong is metal?\"\n\nIn the movies, they pretty much never use real explosives. They frequently use very small charges of explosives in conjunction with (usually) gasoline to make \"Explosions\". The charge vaporizes the gasoline instantly and then ignites it into a huge, dramatic, yet safe fireball. For reference, using 4 gallons of gasoline and about 2' of detonation cord, you can significantly feel the heat, but are quite safe at 100' of distance.

      "TED is amazing. And I know that it's been going on so long that TED sometimes feels like a parody of itself, but to be at TED there's a couple of things I didn't realize. One is that all of the speakers, all the people who are giving talks at ted, are all a little bit freaked out about the weight of that red dot. \n\n\nYou know, you give your TED talk on this big round red carpet, and it does carry a weight. And the weight is that you want your talk to be resonant, and to be good. Because you do that, we're all working really hard on our talks. \n\n\nI spent so many hours running my talk, maybe 200 times. I memorized it until I could forget it and feel natural about delivering it, and it's a deep amount of work to get that. And everyone else is also freaking out about their talk, to get it right, and that engenders a bond between speakers that is really lovely. I made several friends at TED who i know will be life long friends, I'm not kidding. \n\n\nThe 2 most impressive talks at TED--one was by a new friend Adam Foss. It hasn't gone live yet, he's a prosecutor, it’s an amazing talk. When it goes up, it’s amazing. The other one was Al Gore, and that talk is up. I love Al Gore -- I believe in his mission. Al Gore is an amazing man, and what he's done for the world is hard to quantify or qualify. But I didn't think of Al Gore as a super dynamic speaker. I'll admit to you, I didn't think of him as like \"Well that's a gold standard\". But Gore got up and did a talk that took us all to school about giving a real talk in public. \n\n\nHe started out a little slow and then gut up to an almost country preacher, barn burner of a speech that's so inspiring at the same time he's calling out the dangers of what we're doing and how our behavior is going to harm us, and he's doing it all off the top of his head. There were no notes, there was no prompter, there was nothing against the back of the hall that he could read, and all of that data is coming out of him so naturally, so easily flowing, and working with the projections behind him that was a masterpiece to watch. And I was sitting next to another speaker and we were both like \"Holy shit balls!\" It was really an education in public speaking from someone who's been doing it for decades on the fly, off the top of their head, working hard. I'm sure he's done the full gamut from extreme preparation to off the cuff. It was really inspiring to see it in person.",

Only THEN did I cut the lid on the table saw. \nTo make that clear: I made the box as a six sided sealed chamber. Once it was dry I set the table saw at the depth that I wanted the lid to be (about 2\" if memory serves) and used the table saw blade to slice through the four sides of the box to separate the lid. This is my preferred way to make sure the lid perfectly aligns with the rest of the box. \nBecause it was to be a piece of NASA hardware, I used unique hinges.

Not just because Hamilton, himself is an amazing historical figure. I am currently reading the Chernow biography of Hamilton and discovering some astonishing things, such as in the middle of the Revolutionary War, Hamilton is in his mid 20s and understands deeply at that point the kind of financial institutions that will help what will then become the United States come to fruition, and is really largely responsible for the financial system we have now. \n\nI know, I know, for better and worse. However, it is astounding to read this history of Hamilton and see how precociously he conceived of this stuff based on his experience in the Revolutionary War and being Washington's right hand man at the tender age of his mid twenties. It's freakishly brilliant. This is something you'll find if you read about any of the founding fathers in any great detail, is that these were some unbelievable brains, incredible minds, and incredible people.

      "All through my time with personal computers from the start, I developed an attitude that things like movement towards newer, better technologies - like the Macintosh computer, like the touchscreen of the iPhone - that these were making the human more important than the technology. We did not have to modify our ways of living. So the human became very important to me. And how do you represent what humanity is?\n\nYou know what, I have things in my head, some very special people in my life that I don't talk about, that mean so much to me from the past. Those little things that I keep in my head are my little secrets. It's a part of my important world, my whole essence of my being. I also believe in honesty. If you tell somebody, \"I am not snooping on you,\" or, \"I am giving you some level of privacy; I will not look in your drawers,\" then you should keep your word and be honest. And I always try to avoid being a snoop myself, and it's rare in time that we can look back and say, \"How should humans be treated?\" Not, \"How can the police run everything?\" \n\nI was brought up in a time when communist Russia under Stalin was thought to be, everybody is spied on, everybody is looked into, every little thing can get you secretly thrown into prison. And, no. We had our Bill of Rights. And it's just dear to me. The Bill of Rights says some bad people won't do certain bad things because we're protecting humans to live as humans. \n\nSo, I come from the side of personal liberties. But there are also other problems. Twice in my life I wrote things that could have been viruses. I threw away every bit of source code. I just got a chill inside. These are dangerous, dangerous things, and if some code gets written in an Apple product that lets people in, bad people are going to find their way to it, very likely. ",
      "Tim Cook is acknowledging the employees of Apple and the customers of Apple as real people. He is continuing a strong tradition that Steve Jobs was known for of making good products that help people do things they want to do in their life, and not taking the company into roads of, \"Oh, we'll make all our money like by knowing you and advertising to you.” We'll make good products. And you know, I started out as a hardware product guy, so I'm glad to see that. \n\nI worry a little bit about - I mean I love my Apple Watch, but - it's taken us into a jewelry market where you're going to buy a watch between $500 or $1100 based on how important you think you are as a person. The only difference is the band in all those watches. Twenty watches from $500 to $1100. The band's the only difference? Well this isn't the company that Apple was originally, or the company that really changed the world a lot. So it might be moving, but you've got to follow, you know. You've got to follow the paths of where the markets are. \n\nEverything else, I'm very approving of Tim Cook, because every time we have a new iOS update, I'm very happy that it's doing things that really affect people. Like transferring calls from my phone to my computer, etc. I really love even the Airplay, and all that. So, I love the software, and I love the hardware, and nothing's letting me down. So I approve very strongly of Tim Cook and the new Apple. I dearly miss Steve Jobs too, but, that's all.",
      "I have that feeling all the time because I like a nice, quiet, simple life. I grew up shy. I'm more into products than I'm into socializing. And I do not carry around my phone answering every text message instantly. I am not one of those people. \n\nI wait until I'm alone in my places and get on my computer and do things where I think I'm more efficient. I really see a lot of people that are dragged into it, but you know, I don't criticize them. When you have change, it's not that the change in how people are behaving different to you is bad or good, it’s just different. \n\nSo that's sort of the modern way, and you know the millennials, every generation wants to criticize the next generation for missing out on things like personal human contact, but I'll tell you a little story. When we started Apple, Steve Jobs and I talked about how we wanted to make blind people as equal and capable as sighted people, and you'd have to say we succeeded when you look at all the people walking down the sidewalk looking down at something in their hands and totally oblivious to everything around them! ",
      "u/andymbrit, I get asked that everywhere. I have pulled so many hundreds of pranks; I pull pranks almost every day! So I can't come up with one funniest prank. Sometimes I like to talk about early ones; when I was so young, how could I have thought of it.\n\nI did like the one where I put a little ticking electronic metronome in a school locker, back when very few people could build such things as a ticking metronome; and I had it rigged so that when you opened the locker, a little tinfoil switch caused the ticking to speed up.",
      "That question might be too hard for any human being. \n\nGreatest invention... I just described one, which was a device to pop anywhere - real tiny, into a glove compartment, a backpack, whatever - and be able to locate it, wherever it is in the world. There are some devices that kind of claim that now, but they don't really work sufficiently. \n\nA device that gives us one extra hour per day?",
      "Well, obviously Apple is the most important thing ever in my life, and it would be no matter what I might go off and try to do outside and say. No I would only say one thing, I am Apple. \n\nWhen I left in '85, the same as when I left in '81, I actually remained an employee on a slight payroll. I had a letter from apple wishing me luck. I sat on a blackboard and showed them what my intent was to go and create as a product, and there was absolutely no conflict. I like to live a life where kinda everyone likes me. I'm just not bad. If somebody is bad to me, I'm still good to them. \n\nSomehow I grew up with these values that seem kind of incredible, so I always was on good terms with Apple and they always liked me, I'm always welcome. I could come by, Steve Jobs would always make sure I had a badge that could get me into any building. I didn't use it much, but I can go there. The only trouble is I'll get mobbed. ",
      "Hi Clyde, thanks. I left Apple partly because i wanted to be, like, a normal person. I didn't want to seek wealth and power, because in my mind it often corrupts people, and I didn't want to be that person who runs a company. The first time I left Apple was an odd accident. I had a plane crash as a pilot. I didn't come out of an amnesia state for five weeks where I didn't know time was passing. When I came out of the amnesia I realized that the Macintosh team (they were my favorite, most creative thinking team at Apple, and I was on that team), would be fine without me. \n\nSo I called up Steve Jobs and told him \"Macintosh team's in great shape, I'm gonna go back to college and get my degree.\" I had one year left to go. If I waited another year it would be too late to ever go back to college again actually. So I went back to Berkeley under the fake name Rocky Raccoon Clark, and that's what it says on my Berkeley diploma. That was the first time I left Apple. I came back and worked as an engineer. When the Macintosh project failed we had to recover with some Apple II projects, took us into the Apple IIGS to keep some money coming into the company for a while as we built the Macintosh market. And then I left the second time because I love startups. I love just a group of two or three or five people talking about an idea and going out and making it a reality. It may not be all the millions and billions of dollars in the world, but it's something you're doing yourself. The idea I came up with was for the first universal remote control, the CL 9 Core, so I left Apple to build that.",
      "Well, I would think probably one of them is certainly the Oculus Rift, or any of the VR headsets. I love putting mine on and watching a basketball game live; it was just an experience that you can't believe. Sometimes I come out of a VR world, take off the helmet, and I can't believe I'm actually sitting in my office, at a desk at home. So, that's one of the big ones. \n\nRight now, Amazon Echo; it's getting so popular among the people that use it and they speak so highly of it, and it's so inexpensive. I see a lot of developers that went into smartphones jumping onto that. It's a platform, and when you have a platform that everybody else is writing apps for and connecting to, basically they're advertising your company as much as you are. \n\nObviously, I'm very interested in the evolution of self-driving cars. Right now, the assist that they give you for keeping in your lane and cruise control...the cruise control started back in 2004 actually, adjusting your distance. I love driving my Tesla so much, I just smile! I sit there in the driver's seat, and I kinda look over at my wife, and I just smile. I'm so happy, not using my hands or feet. So, I think the progression towards self-driving cars is going to be a good one. But it falls into that category of AI.\n\nNow, the AI that impresses me, I fell in love 10 years ago - well not 10 years ago, but whenever it started; Siri was an app you could buy for the iPhone, and I bought it. And for one year, Apple didn't have it. I just spoke of it as the app that changed my life, because I get to live as a human, saying things out of my head the way I would to another human, and a machine understands me. And I have wanted that to be the future for...forever. \n\nActually, ever since our Newton message pad, where I could type in, \"Sara, dentist, Tuesday, 2 PM,\" and click the assist button, and it would open up the calendar; Tuesday at 2 PM, it would put the word *dentist*, and it would grab *Sara* out of my contact list. I hand wrote with my own muscles a message for myself, for a human, and a machine understood me. So, I want that to get better and better; machines understanding what we mean, so that we can eventually communicate with them as our best, most trusted friends that know our own hearts and souls better than other humans. ",
      "You know what, I'd go back to the early days. There has to be a start of something, just like personal computers. You know, I'd go back to the old, boring — like Superman. You know, I like all of them about equally. I love all of the ones in the Avengers, I love Spiderman, Batman. I don't have a personal favorite at all. It's just the whole genre, you know. Every one of them reaches me emotionally the same way as the others.",
      "Creating new things is hard enough on its own; you don't have time to think about, \"Oh, there'll be security issues.\" Keep in mind that the original Apple computers, for quite a long time, were not connected to networks or the Internet. They were just, the computer was in your hands, it would run a program that would help you with some of your daily work, or some problems you needed to solve. \n\nToday, our computers are just sitting out in data centers, and the devices in our hands are simply displaying what the data centers have taken all the information off of hard disks, assembled it, analyzed it, computed it, and sent it back to us. So really, our computers are anonymous. They're out there somewhere, and who knows what their safety and security level is. We didn't even have to think about that. \n\nAlmost every time a technology is brand new, it leaves security as a later concern. Look at the phone system in the United States. When I was young, you could put tones into a United States phone if you learned about \"phone phreaking,\" and you could cause calls to be dialed for free anywhere in the world. Who would have thought the phone system would have such a simple flaw? Well actually, they just didn't think people would be able to build tone generators in about... forever. ",
      "I don't tinker the way I did in the old days. The last time I tinkered was to build a little Segway key burner where I could twist some dials, set my own speed codes on it, and tell the segway how fast it was allowed to go. \n\nI keep my soldering iron and tools handy, but I have such a busy life; public speaking, I'm with a company that's working on storage and data centers, I'm putting on Comic Cons. Such a busy life, it's hard to get the time to tinker, but I admire the young people and my older friends who do that. I just admire them so greatly. It's really where the great future products are going to come from. \n\nI think it's much less important to get somebody who has PhDs in all these subjects. If you can find somebody who never went to college but has built a lot of things as a tinkerer -  knows how to operate the equipment, run into their own little garage or laboratory quickly and whip something out - that's the person that companies are missing out on, and all their requisition requirements overlook those people.\n\nI can admire the tinkerers.",
      "I don't remember who first called me Woz, I remember that nickname started coming to me when I was working at Hewlett Packard '73, '74, '75, around the start of Apple for some reason. So that became sort of a name I used to identify myself with Apple and the new products. \n\nI found out later in life that almost every Wozniak gets the nickname Woz over time. Their friends just start calling them that. My uncle is Uncle Woz. My son, his friends call him Woz, and I turn to my kid and I realize they’re talking to Gary instead. So it goes back. It's just nice. \n\nI like short simple things in technology, so I like shortening my name, I like shortening my signature. And what a privilege to grow up like Sting where one word and people know who you are",
      "I was lucky to be a good, top student, getting the math awards at my schools, so you get a little bit of a head start, and things like STEM subjects build upon each other. If you've been good the year before, you're more likely to do very well the next year. When I was in college though, I was actually rather unfocused. I had my own loves in my life that were not taught. All the way through school we had nothing about computers. No books in bookstores, not even magazines, and that was the passion of my life. \n\nSo I stumbled into things by accident, and I'm very thankful for all those accidents. But I tended to get an idea in my head, and I'd just want to go off in that direction and do it. A focused student is someone who does all the right homework and gets all the right grades and they answer all the questions the same as somebody else that's called smart, you know. And I don't know, I always wanted to be in a different world, think differently. So I wasn't all that focused.\n\nI just kept building things for the fun of it, and I wasn't worried about I've got to meet some specs to have a company that makes money. So I'm very thankful I had a great friend who was always after having companies and money and turning things into more, and that was Steve Jobs.",
      "You have the right team. Hopefully you all have great skills. But you know, something more important than skills, more important than education is motivation. Wanting to do something. Having your own reason. And one of the things you should do is separate yourself off from the money. \n\nThere's a great quote that I came across from Russell Simmons \"Operate from a place of needing nothing. Needing nothing attracts everything.\" And I find that so true in so many places in life. Be willing to go out and build stuff that you like, even if it doesn't seem like it's a huge business success right away. Your learning from it will put you in the position to build those devices that someday in the future maybe have a major relevance on the world.\n\nOne thing is humility doesn't matter. You don't have to act like you have everything, know everything. Try and make common sense decisions, but look at Apple. The image of starting in a garage, as true and untrue as it isn't, it still represents the humility. You start at home, you're with your own friends, you guys are working for nothing, that's really exactly the same as how Apple started, and hopefully you're in a field that grows.",
      "I had an easy life. I was so good in math, science, electronics, computers, way ahead of the world, that I would never have to worry about a job. So, I didn't even have obstacles of, *how am I going to get a good job or do these things?* \n\nCertainly in my early design days, I sometimes tackled problems that I didn't know if it was possible to solve, but when I'd get there I'd try to look for a solution, and somehow I always found it. Magic was pouring out of me, back in those days. \n\nIn later times, well, I've had divorces. So I guess you could say those are obstacles in life that I regret. But sometimes you grow up with a geekish personality that isn't really very social, and I dunno, you wind up in places you shouldn't have been. \n\nLet's see, other obstacles...I described one earlier about a product I was trying to make, to locate things like pets and cars and briefcases. The obstacles that I ran into were whether I could come up with some magic ideas. And I did come up with at least one magic idea, but it didn't achieve the results I wanted in terms of price, power usage, and size. \n\nBasically I think obstacles do a lot with dealing with people, and I work very independently, as far as I can, and then turn it over to others in very complete forms. So I didn't have a lot of the obstacles some people would talk about. \n\nObviously in business, we ran into obstacles at Apple. We all believed so much in doing the right thing, and building the Macintosh for the future rather than keeping with the dumb old computers of the past, and trying to achieve the world market. You know, holding our percentage of the world market as it grew ten times. We let Microsoft have all that growth, because we believed in doing the right things. Would you ever look back and say you regretted it or it was an obstacle? No. It was something we had to work hard to finally build a Macintosh market, and get our company back. But, we did the right thing. ",
      "I don't have any incredibly visionary answers. Basically, the form of the human body has defined what kind of devices work for us in what ways, you know? In other words, the shape of a rake or a broom hasn't had to change a lot in many years, and what fits into the hand and is easily useable and accessible, I expect major smartphones are going to look the same in 10 years.\n\nWearables are becoming very attractive because of the less hassle to use them. I like picking up my watch, and asking it to send a quick text to my wife, or using it for other things without having to pull the phone out of my pocket.\n\nOne of my favorites of all is the Amazon Echo, because I don't have to move or pull anything out of my pocket. I don't even have to get out of the sheets in bed to use it.",
      "I don't remember which sound card this is about. I actually do dream up devices that would be cool all the time, and I don't really form a list that I'm working on in my memory. I just keep them inside of me and they come up when they're needed. Usually I'm looking for an underlying technology developed by physics people and chemistry people on a new type of chip that didn't exist before that makes something possible that wasn't possible before. \n\nI had a start-up company to make a little device that would be very low cost, you know like $30 in the grocery store, and you could just pop in anywhere and the battery would last for a year and it would be a little detection device that would notify you if your dog got out of the fence at home, or where your car is located if you forget, and I failed. I failed on technology grounds of cost, size, and the amount of power usage. \n\nBut I swear to god, I just keep thinking all the time about the technology advances that would have to be done to make that device possible. So maybe I'll even get back to it someday.",
      "These days I'm wearing an Apple Watch. It's the stainless steel sapphire one. I like that it's got a magnetic band. I don't remember where it was on the price scale... I think it's kinda towards the low end of all those watches. But I just love this little flexible magnetic bend. \n\nOf course, every once in awhile I'll put my hand on a table in a restaurant, and pull my hand back, and it pulls back the fork with me, that attaches to the magnet of the watch. That's kinda funny. \n\nThe evolution of personal computers, from the start on, usually when the changes got made, they got made in terms of input and output; the display resolution and how you signal your input. At first, you typed on a keyboard. Then, you got to go to a mouse where you could point at things as well. Now you can reach your hand out and drag things. So, the watch is just another evolution where basically about all you can do on it is talk and tap a little, but speaking into it commands it, and it's just closer to you. The input/output is closer to you, and easier to use. \n\nBut you know, I had some other smart watches, and I got turned off. One of them I kinda liked actually, called the Martian Watch. It was a very very simple one, but you could talk Siri commands into it. But I had the first Galaxy Gear, and after half a day, it just turned me off that it was separated; it felt between me and my phone. Whereas, the Apple Watch does some amazing things with Apple Pay, boarding passes for airplanes, and all the Siri commands that work. I do wish the speaker were louder.",
      "Apple is a huge huge company in the world, and a huge company to look at opportunities that they should really tackle and put high investment in, would have to be big in dollar volume. Look at the size of the car market. Here we are at the turning point of cars, we might be heading towards replacing gas-driven cars with electric cars some day. Maybe Tesla is the first real star of realizing that the formula is the equivalent of gas stations on the highway for electric cars. So electric cars are coming and the self-driving cars with artificial intelligence, looking at everything and spotting stop signs.\n\nA couple months ago my wife got rear ended. Totaled actually, totaled in one of our cars, and the girl was crying from breaking up with her girlfriend and didn't see the red light. But if she'd been driving some kind of self-aware car, it would have stopped because of the red light. So I think that we're really going to improve life a lot with some of those things, and that's where Apple likes to be. Basically making products that make a better world for the users. So the car market makes total sense to me for Apple, but the important thing is that I hope if they get off on a product, something that they could sell and make a lot of money for but is not \"insanely great\" as Steve jobs would say, Apple should drop it and start over. \n\nAnd I think I read recently that some executives or some executive from Apple's car division left. Well, I think that's good if Apple says \"We're not making the product that is going to stimulate all of humanity, that's not our business as Apple. We don't want to just be another another electric car or self driving car,” or whatever. So I'm really for that in Apple.",

      "Making jokes and playing pranks!\n\nTo tell you the truth, I don't really have a lot of free time, because I do a lot of public speaking, and so when I get free time like at home, it's often only a couple days here, a couple days there. There are different months - right now I'm at the end of about 2 to 3 months worth - where I had mostly to myself, and that's wonderful, too. \n\nWhen I have free time, I like to go to all the normal entertainment things, go to the movies. My wife and I, oddly enough, maybe go to 50 concerts a year, and we almost always only go to the small little ones. We have to drive an hour to San Francisco to get to all the little small playrooms and music bars; tiny to medium-sized places. In the time I've known my wife, we've rarely, rarely - maybe only two times ever - gone to an arena concert, because everybody does that. I mean, thank god we went to the Springsteen one the other night, but that's rare rare rare. \n\nAnd we like movies, we like reading books, we like driving a ton. When you're home with short periods for vacation time, oh, we love our road trips so much, and audio books. We love listening to those together, or talking, or listening to music on the way. Fortunately we like the same things, and books, and music, and politics, and everything! ",
      "I am a part, but not as much as I was. I used to be on a team that practiced every week, and now, I'm not around very much and they don't have that many practices around where I live. So, kind of about once a year when the final International championship comes up, or the European championships, I'll fly over and participate and play. It's a skill you don't totally forget. \n\nBut if you're thinking about polo, you have to have strong hands with a mallet, and I have very weak hands now; I'm getting older, so I'm not really a good player. But I was a very good player once! And I love the sport very much. My wife and I both play it, and we even got married at one of the segway polo matches, on 08/08/08 at 8:08 PM, of course.",
      "Almost everyone I know that's in technology absolutely speaks that there should be equal salaries, and equal job opportunities. However, I tend to hang around normal, bottom-of-the-org chart people; they're my favorite people! And maybe up the management chain, there are different ways of thinking. Sometimes you say and feel, \"I want there to be gender equality,\" or ethnic equality, and yet something inside you subconsciously - not really on your brain or words you say to people - drives you to think differently and act differently. So, it's kind of unseen. \n\nI will make one strong comment. When I went back to college in CS at Berkeley, about three-fourths of the students were from southeast Asian countries where they grow up strong in the STEM subjects, and they were 50/50 male/female; equal gender distribution. Among the caucasians, it was more like 90/10 males in computer science or engineering. \n\nIt's just something in the culture that's so big, there's no answer for it. There's no one person who can answer it. We can certainly try some kind of affirmative action; I'm actually for it, to make up for errors of the past that still are prolonged and go on with us."

I barely have time to sleep, let alone become bored.\n\n2) Confidential government documents we have published disclose evidence of war crimes, criminal back-room dealings and sundry abuses. That alone legitimates our publications, and that principally motivates our work. Secrecy was never intended to enable criminality in the highest offices of state. Secrecy is, yes, sometimes necessary, but healthy democracies understand that secrecy is the exception, not the rule. \"National security\" pretexts for secrecy are routinely used by powerful officials, but seldom justified. If we accept these terms of propaganda, strong national security journalism becomes impossible. Our publications have never jeopardized the \"national security\" of any nation. When secrecy is a cover-all for endemic official criminality, I suggest to you, it bespeaks a strange set of priorities to ask journalists to justify their own existence.\n",

      "Firstly, people who argue that ISIS poses a threat to our democracies are out to lunch. ISIS is an ugly phenomenon, but it's largely the consequence of one blunder after another by the US and its allies in the region, who shouldn't have been meddling there in the first place. If ISIS poses a threat to anyone, it is to countries in the region, and they are the appropriate parties to address it. If the US and its allies want to reduce \"terror\" in the region - as Noam Chomsky says - they need to stop participating in it.\n\nThe US and the UK, etc, have no business in the region, so the idea that they need to gather intelligence there is wrong, never mind the idea that they need to do it through mass surveillance, as opposed to targeted surveillance. Remember, mass surveillance means targeting everyone, not just the people who are identified as a threat. Mass surveillance provides little advantage against something like ISIS. They can be surveilled through normal targeted surveillence methods, without the need to scoop up every innocent person's communications with it. And ISIS likely has accomplished opsec and infosec, so, again, mass surveillance disproportionately affects innocents, and provides little advantage.\n\nIn the meantime, a real threat to democracies is the erosion of civil liberties that is brought about by mass surveillance.",

In small societies the path length between individuals is also small, so it is easier to know what is going on in government. Transparency is enforced by proximity and cultural norms as well as bureaucratic standards. See https://immi.is/\n\nThe Associated Press has quantified this in some great 2011 research; basically, the \"old\" democracies are in a state of decay and the \"new\" democracies eclipse them in their striving to be something:\n\n— Newer democracies were in general more responsive than some developed ones. Guatemala confirmed the AP request in 72 hours, and sent all documents in 10 days. Turkey sent spreadsheets and data within seven days. Mexico posted responses on the Web. By comparison, Canada asked for a 200-day extension. The FBI in the United States responded six months late with a single sheet with four dates, two words and a large section blanked. Austria never responded at all.\n— More than half the countries did not release anything, and three out of 10 did not even acknowledge the request. African governments led the world for ignoring requests, with no response whatsoever from 11 out of 15 countries.\n— Dozens of countries adopted their laws at least in part because of financial incentives, and so are more likely to ignore them or limit their impact. China changed its access-to-information rules as a condition to joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, to boost the economy by as much as 10 percent.

      "There's lots on Bitcoin in my book - on my thoughts on it, and on WikiLeaks' history with it. Eric Schmidt and I conversed for a while about it, and I also included a lot of notes to expand on my views. It's a fascinating and complex subject, so I can't possibly go through all of it. But here's footnote 23 as a teaser:\n\n> On 5 December 2010, just after VISA, MasterCard, PayPal, Amazon, and other financial companies started denying service to WikiLeaks, a debate broke out on the official web forum for Bitcoin about the risk that donations to WikiLeaks using Bitcoin could provoke unwanted government interest in the then nascent crypto-currency. “Basically, bring it on,” wrote one poster. “Satoshi Nakamoto,” the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin, responded: “No, don’t ‘bring it on.’ The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.” See the post on the Bitcoin Forum: archive.today/Gvonb#msg26999. \tSix days later, on 12 December 2010, Satoshi famously vanished from the Bitcoin community, but not before posting this message: “It would have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has kicked the hornet’s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.” See the post on the Bitcoin Forum: archive.today/XuHCD#selection-1803.0-1802.1. \tWikiLeaks read and agreed with Satoshi’s analysis, and decided to put off the launch of a Bitcoin donation channel until the currency had become more established. WikiLeaks’ Bitcoin donation address was launched after the currency’s first major boom, on 14 June 2011.\n\nAnd here's footnote 185:\n\n>On the day of the conversation [with Eric Schmidt], Bitcoin had risen above the US dollar and reached price parity with the Euro. By early 2014 it had risen to over $1,000, before falling to $430 as other Bitcoin-derived competing crypto-currencies started to take off.

      "I've been writing and warning people about the NSA since the 1990s, so it's no surprise to me that people don't understand scale and complexity when state power is also pushing against the story. The surprise is that people, for a moment, took notice as a result of the very public and dramatic manhunt against Edward Snowden.\n\nHere's what I wrote in 2012:\n\nExcerpted from Cypherpunks: Freedom and the Future of the Internet, by Julian Assange with Jacob Appelbaum, Andy Müller-Maguhn and Jérémie Zimmermann. OR Books, New York, 2012, 186 pages, Paper. Buy online. Cryptome review of the book.\n\nPages 1-7.\n\nINTRODUCTION: A CALL TO CRYPTOGRAPHIC ARMS\n\nThis book is not a manifesto. There is not time for that. This book is a warning.\n\nThe world is not sliding, but galloping into a new transnational dystopia. This development has not been properly recognized outside of national security circles. It has been hidden by secrecy, complexity and scale. The internet, our greatest tool of emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen. The internet is a threat to human civilization.\n\nThese transformations have come about silently, because those who know what is going on work in the global surveillance industry and have no incentives to speak out. Left to its own trajectory, within a few years, global civilization will be a postmodern surveillance dystopia, from which escape for all but the most skilled individuals will be impossible. In fact, we may already be there.\n\nWhile many writers have considered what the internet means for global civilization, they are wrong. They are wrong because they do not have the sense of perspective that direct experience brings. They are wrong because they have never met the enemy.\n\nNo description of the world survives first contact with the enemy.\n\nWe have met the enemy.\n\nOver the last six years WikiLeaks has had conflicts with nearly every powerful state. We know the new surveillance state from an insider's perspective, because we have plumbed its secrets. We know it from a combatant's perspective, because we have had to protect our people, our finances and our sources from it. We know it from a global perspective, because we have people, assets and information in nearly every country. We know it from the perspective of time, because we have been fighting this phenomenon for years and have seen it double and spread, again and again. It is an invasive parasite, growing fat off societies that merge with the internet. It is rolling over the planet, infecting all states and peoples before it.\n[..]\n\nDoes it even make sense to ask this question? In this otherworldly space, this seemingly platonic realm of ideas and information flow, could there be a notion of coercive force? A force that could modify historical records, tap phones, separate people, transform complexity into rubble, and erect walls, like an occupying army?\n\nThe platonic nature of the internet, ideas and information flows, is debased by its physical origins. Its foundations are fiber optic cable lines stretching across the ocean floors, satellites spinning above our heads, computer servers housed in buildings in cities from New York to Nairobi. Like the soldier who slew Archimedes with a mere sword, so too could an armed militia take control of the peak development of Western civilization, our platonic realm.\n\nThe new world of the internet, abstracted from the old world of brute atoms, longed for independence. But states and their friends moved to control our new world -- by controlling its physical underpinnings. The state, like an army around an oil well, or a customs agent extracting bribes at the border, would soon learn to leverage its control of physical space to gain control over our platonic realm. It would prevent the independence we had dreamed of, and then, squatting on fiber optic lines and around satellite ground stations, it would go on to mass intercept the information flow of our new world -- its very essence even as every human, economic, and political relationship embraced it. The state would leech into the veins and arteries of our new societies, gobbling up every relationship expressed or communicated, every web page read, every message sent and every thought googled, and then store this knowledge, billions of interceptions a day, undreamed of power, in vast top secret warehouses, forever. It would go on to mine and mine again this treasure, the collective private intellectual output of humanity, with ever more sophisticated search and pattern finding algorithms, enriching the treasure and maximizing the power imbalance between interceptors and the world of interceptees. And then the state would reflect what it had learned back into the physical world, to start wars, to target drones, to manipulate UN committees and trade deals, and to do favors for its vast connected network of industries, insiders and cronies.\n\nBut we discovered something. Our one hope against total domination. A hope that with courage, insight and solidarity we could use to resist. A strange property of the physical universe that we live in.\n\nThe universe believes in encryption.\n\nIt is easier to encrypt information than it is to decrypt it.\n\nWe saw we could use this strange property to create the laws of a new world. To abstract away our new platonic realm from its base underpinnings of satellites, undersea cables and their controllers. To fortify our space behind a cryptographic veil. To create new lands barred to those who control physical reality, because to follow us into them would require infinite resources.\n\nAnd in this manner to declare independence.\n\nScientists in the Manhattan Project discovered that the universe permitted the construction of a nuclear bomb. This was not an obvious conclusion. Perhaps nuclear weapons were not within the laws of physics. However, the universe believes in atomic bombs and nuclear reactors. They are a phenomenon the universe blesses, like salt, sea or stars.\n\nSimilarly, the universe, our physical universe, has that property that makes it possible for an individual or a group of individuals to reliably, automatically, even without knowing, encipher something, so that all the resources and all the political will of the strongest superpower on earth may not decipher it. And the paths of encipherment between people can mesh together to create regions free from the coercive force of the outer state. Free from mass interception. Free from state control.\n\nIn this way, people can oppose their will to that of a fully mobilized superpower and win. Encryption is an embodiment of the laws of physics, and it does not listen to the bluster of states, even transnational surveillance dystopias.\n\nIt isn't obvious that the world had to work this way. But somehow the universe smiles on encryption.\n\nCryptography is the ultimate form of non-violent direct action. While nuclear weapons states can exert unlimited violence over even millions of individuals, strong cryptography means that a state, even by exercising unlimited violence, cannot violate the intent of individuals to keep secrets from them.\n\nStrong cryptography can resist an unlimited application of violence. No amount of coercive force will ever solve a math problem.\n\nBut could we take this strange fact about the world and build it up to be a basic emancipatory building block for the independence of mankind in the platonic realm of the internet? And as societies merged with the internet could that liberty then be reflected back into physical reality to redefine the state?\n\nRecall that states are the systems which determine where and how coercive force is consistently applied.\n\nThe question of how much coercive force can seep into the platonic realm of the internet from the physical world is answered by cryptography and the cypherpunks' ideals.\n\nAs states merge with the internet and the future of our civilization becomes the future of the internet, we must redefine force relations.\n\nIf we do not, the universality of the internet will merge global humanity into one giant grid of mass surveillance and mass control.\n\nWe must raise an alarm. This book is a watchman's shout in the night.\n\nOn March 20, 2012, while under house arrest in the United Kingdom awaiting extradition, I met with three friends and fellow watchmen on the principle that perhaps in unison our voices can wake up the town. We must communicate what we have learned while there is still a chance for you, the reader, to understand and act on what is happening.\n\nIt is time to take up the arms of our new world, to fight for ourselves and for those we love.\n\nOur task is to secure self-determination where we can, to hold back the coming dystopia where we cannot, and if all else fails, to accelerate its self-destruction.\n\n-- Julian Assange, London, October 2012 \n\nhttp://cryptome.xxx/2012/12/assange-wl-arms-xxx.htm",
      "Most whistleblowers concentrate on their issue and their own legal cases, which can absord a lot of time and attention as it's their life or liberty on the line. Some also want to stick to one issue or another inorder to not generate additional opposition or muddy their messages. It's hard to fault them on this--if only we could fault the rest of the population for such intellectual provincialism!\n\nWe shouldn't expect specialists to be wise generalists, in say the manner Chomsky has become. That said, many of them do take on an more geopolitical or systemic view after 10 years of so of exposure. Look for example at the development of Thomas Drake. \n\n\nParticular government departments have the responsibility to keep some information secret for a limited period of time inorder to forfil their public mission, for example, the massive FBI investigation of legal violations at the NSA (ha). However the primary responsibility of international publishers of last resort (i.e WikiLeaks) is publish fearlessly and not to cover up for the incompetancies or malign behavior of other actors in international society.",
      "\nEdward Snowden has said that he was inspired by Chelsea Manning. The US government wanted to publically destroy Manning, in a grotesque way, as a warning. They did not succeed but I realised we can do even better! This is part of the reason why we put a lot of resources and risk into getting Edward Snowden asylum. He is now mostly free, living a forfilling life of respect, an inspirational symbol for whistleblowers world wide and not a general deterrant suffering in a US prison unable to defend himself or promote his cause in public.\n\n\n\nAs I type these lines, on June 3, 2013, Private First Class Bradley Edward Manning is being tried in a sequestered room at Fort Meade, Maryland, for the alleged crime of telling the truth. The court martial of the most prominent political prisoner in modern US history has now, finally, begun.\n\nIt has been three years. Bradley Manning, then 22 years old, was arrested in Baghdad on May 26, 2010. He was shipped to Kuwait, placed into a cage, and kept in the sweltering heat of Camp Arifjan.\n\n\"For me, I stopped keeping track,\" he told the court last November. \"I didn’t know whether night was day or day was night. And my world became very, very small. It became these cages... I remember thinking I’m going to die.\"\n\nAfter protests from his lawyers, Bradley Manning was then transferred to a brig at a US Marine Corps Base in Quantico, VA, where - infamously - he was subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment at the hands of his captors - a formal finding by the UN. Isolated in a tiny cell for twenty-three out of twenty-four hours a day, he was deprived of his glasses, sleep, blankets and clothes, and prevented from exercising. All of this - it has been determined by a military judge - \"punished\" him before he had even stood trial.\n\n\"Brad’s treatment at Quantico will forever be etched, I believe, in our nation’s history, as a disgraceful moment in time\" said his lawyer, David Coombs. \"Not only was it stupid and counterproductive, it was criminal.\"\n\nThe United States was, in theory, a nation of laws. But it is no longer a nation of laws for Bradley Manning.\n\nWhen the abuse of Bradley Manning became a scandal reaching all the way to the President of the United States and Hillary Clinton’s spokesman resigned to register his dissent over Mr. Manning’s treatment, an attempt was made to make the problem less visible. Bradley Manning was transferred to the Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nHe has waited in prison for three years for a trial - 986 days longer than the legal maximum - because for three years the prosecution has dragged its feet and obstructed the court, denied the defense access to evidence and abused official secrecy. This is simply illegal - all defendants are constitutionally entitled to a speedy trial - but the transgression has been acknowledged and then overlooked.\n\nAgainst all of this, it would be tempting to look on the eventual commencement of his trial as a mercy. But that is hard to do.\n\nWe no longer need to comprehend the \"Kafkaesque\" through the lens of fiction or allegory. It has left the pages and lives among us, stalking our best and brightest. It is fair to call what is happening to Bradley Manning a \"show trial\". Those invested in what is called the \"US military justice system\" feel obliged to defend what is going on, but the rest of us are free to describe this travesty for what it is. No serious commentator has any confidence in a benign outcome. The pretrial hearings have comprehensively eliminated any meaningful uncertainty, inflicting pre-emptive bans on every defense argument that had any chance of success.\n\nBradley Manning may not give evidence as to his stated intent (exposing war crimes and their context), nor may he present any witness or document that shows that no harm resulted from his actions. Imagine you were put on trial for murder. In Bradley Manning’s court, you would be banned from showing that it was a matter of self-defence, because any argument or evidence as to intent is banned. You would not be able to show that the ’victim’ is, in fact, still alive, because that would be evidence as to the lack of harm.\n\nBut of course. Did you forget whose show it is?\n\nThe government has prepared for a good show. The trial is to proceed for twelve straight weeks: a fully choreographed extravaganza, with a 141-strong cast of prosecution witnesses. The defense was denied permission to call all but a handful of witnesses. Three weeks ago, in closed session, the court actually held a rehearsal. Even experts on military law have called this unprecedented.\n\nBradley Manning’s conviction is already written into the script. The commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces, Barack Obama, spoiled the plot for all of us when he pronounced Bradley Manning guilty two years ago. \"He broke the law,\" President Obama stated, when asked on camera at a fundraiser about his position on Mr. Manning. In a civilized society, such a prejudicial statement alone would have resulted in a mistrial.\n\nTo convict Bradley Manning, it will be necessary for the US government to conceal crucial parts of his trial. Key portions of the trial are to be conducted in secrecy: 24 prosecution witnesses will give secret testimony in closed session, permitting the judge to claim that secret evidence justifies her decision. But closed justice is no justice at all.\n\nWhat cannot be shrouded in secrecy will be hidden through obfuscation. The remote situation of the courtroom, the arbitrary and discretionary restrictions on access for journalists, and the deliberate complexity and scale of the case are all designed to drive fact-hungry reporters into the arms of official military PR men, who mill around the Fort Meade press room like over-eager sales assistants. The management of Bradley Manning’s case will not stop at the limits of the courtroom. It has already been revealed that the Pentagon is closely monitoring press coverage and social media discussions on the case.\n\nThis is not justice; never could this be justice. The verdict was ordained long ago. Its function is not to determine questions such as guilt or innocence, or truth or falsehood. It is a public relations exercise, designed to provide the government with an alibi for posterity. It is a show of wasteful vengeance; a theatrical warning to people of conscience.\n\nThe alleged act in respect of which Bradley Manning is charged is an act of great conscience - the single most important disclosure of subjugated history, ever. There is not a political system anywhere on the earth that has not seen light as a result. In court, in February, Bradley Manning said that he wanted to expose injustice, and to provoke worldwide debate and reform. Bradley Manning is accused of being a whistleblower, a good man, who cared for others and who followed higher orders. Bradley Manning is effectively accused of conspiracy to commit journalism.\n\nBut this is not the language the prosecution uses. The most serious charge against Bradley Manning is that he \"aided the enemy\" - a capital offence that should require the greatest gravity, but here the US government laughs at the world, to breathe life into a phantom. The government argues that Bradley Manning communicated with a media organisation, WikiLeaks, who communicated to the public. It also argues that al-Qaeda (who else) is a member of the public. Hence, it argues that Bradley Manning communicated \"indirectly\" with al-Qaeda, a formally declared US \"enemy\", and therefore that Bradley Manning communicated with \"the enemy\".\n\nBut what about \"aiding\" in that most serious charge, \"aiding the enemy\"? Don’t forget that this is a show trial. The court has banned any evidence of intent. The court has banned any evidence of the outcome, the lack of harm, the lack of any victim. It has ruled that the government doesn’t need to show that any \"aiding\" occurred and the prosecution doesn’t claim it did. The judge has stated that it is enough for the prosecution to show that al-Qaeda, like the rest of the world, reads WikiLeaks.\n\n“Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people,\" wrote John Adams, \"who have a right and a desire to know.”\n\nWhen communicating with the press is \"aiding the enemy\" it is the \"general knowledge among the people\" itself which has become criminal. Just as Bradley Manning is condemned, so too is that spirit of liberty in which America was founded.\n\nIn the end it is not Bradley Manning who is on trial. His trial ended long ago. The defendent now, and for the next 12 weeks, is the United States. A runaway military, whose misdeeds have been laid bare, and a secretive government at war with the public. They sit in the docks. We are called to serve as jurists. We must not turn away.",

The mass surveillance of significant portions of the world's population is an ongoing violation of rights on a mass scale. Putting an end to it - pending a full investigation into who was responsible, and who gave the orders - would be a good first step. Official channels for releasing documents exist: FOI laws, for instance, and declassification laws. I would support making these stronger and more transparent, of course.

      "Google can certainly do something better to fight privacy violations and protect their users. For instance, in the book, you'll see that I asked Eric Schmidt to leak secret government requests to WikiLeaks. He refused. On a larger scale, companies like Google have a lot more heft than, say, Lavabit. Imagine Google had engaged in the kind of resistance to a government order that Ladar Levison engaged in. Google's population is gigantic. That would be a serious challenge to the US government. But you won't see that happen, because - as I argue in the book - Google is too close to the government.\n\nBut in a wider sense, I think it is misguided to be looking to Google to help get us out of this mess. In large part, Google has us in this mess.

      "TRANSCRIPT:\nThis is the whole proof of life topic. We saw that evolve. It’s both gratifying and alarming. I will explain why.\n\nI the rest of the team at WikiLeaks were very pleased there was such an expression of concern about how we were doing. We expected attacks against me. If you looked at my public statements and some of the statements tweeted by WikiLeaks in the lead up to my Internet being cut off and to that difficult diplomatic situation, we were saying that the attacks are going to come in and we will need people to defend us, we’re going to need an army to get through this. And then the concern for how I was doing and why I wasn’t being seen arose.\n\nMany were calling for \"proof of life\" but we are interested in something quite different. Anything that we did that claimed to be some kind of proof of life would be to set the precedent on what mechanism could be used to reduce concern about how we were faring. The calls, for example, that I issue a PGP signed message. \n\nThat's fine if you can understand that it’s me issuing the PGP signed message, but a PGP signed message doesn’t tell you who has issued it at all. It’s just a plain message. So, let’s look at what kind of precedent we would be setting. We would be setting the precedent that when there’s a concern about whether one of our staff has been kidnapped or me, that concern can be destroyed simply by someone issuing of a message of text, which is coupled to a particular cryptographic key. \n\nBut if WikiLeaks is under a threat so serious that its people have been kidnapped then it is possible that it might lose control over its keys. The reality is that it’s quite hard to protect keys from that kind of interference. The way WikiLeaks manages its keys, its submission keys, for example, they are not used to sign messages, but even if WikiLeaks did sign a message in this case, what would it be saying? It would be setting a precedent that could be very dangerous in the future.\n\nIf you produce the person and show that they are not under duress, you can either hack a WikiLeaks key or take control of infrastructure or take control of a person and then claim that they had produced some signed message.\n\nWe are much more interested in creating a precedent for proof of freedom from duress. Or making it hard for our people to be under duress. The best way to do that is live video. Because even if you were under duress (there’s various forms of duress that could be applied) if you have live video then you’ve got a few seconds to put things out. You can slip in code words into what you’re saying. (I’m not, by the way. I’m not!) But you can slip in code words into what you’re saying that your people could then see. So, yes, I’m alive and free from duress, but I *am* in a very difficult situation.\n\nI have been for six years. Let’s not think that I’m not in a difficult situation just because I am alive. As I explained, this embassy is surrounded by high tech police and intelligence operation. It is a difficult situation. I haven’t seen the sunlight in the last four and half years. It’s a tough situation. I’m tough, but you should be concerned about the situation.\n\nWhat we had hoped is those people concerned with my safety would direct their attention to those people who are responsible for the situation. That’s the UK government, the US government, and the Ecuadorian government. Some of you did and that’s quite possibly why my Internet has been restored--because of the expression of concern.\n\nBut, when the concern became very prominent, a black PR campaign infested the concern and tried take it off somewhere else and largely succeeded.\n\nWhat happened? Fabricated messages, claiming to be from our staff were posted on 4Chan on Reddit. Fabricated videos claiming to be from Anonymous [posted on YouTube]. Completely fabricated. Dozens of them. And what was their intent? What were they calling for? They were calling for people to not trust WikiLeaks, to not give it leaks, and to not give it funds!\n\nIt’s obvious who benefits from the production of such a black PR campaign and it should be obvious in hindsight to all those people who were trying to support me that those types of messages were deliberately intended to undermine WikiLeaks and, in fact, undermine my support.\n\nIf this sort of thing happens in the future, think to yourselves, is what is claimed undermining the ability for WikiLeaks to operate, the ability for it to get new information, and the ability for it to financially support itself? And if the answer is yes then you should be extremely skeptical about what the claim is.\n\nHaving seen how concern for us can be manipulated and misled, but also the degree of concern, we now have a game plan for if this kind of thing happens again and I am confident about the kind of worldwide support we can get, if we get a similar type of attack again in the future.\n\nYou can see that I am speaking and maybe, apparently, sane, but don’t reduce your concern. I am in a difficult situation. That’s a reality. But the difficulty of the situation [has long been] expressed on Justice4Assange.com, UN findings, etc.\n\nWikiLeaks itself are also in a difficult situation. Constantly spied upon, harassed, etc. So, support us now. Don’t wait until we are in a situation that might be difficult to get out of. Make sure we are strong now, going into difficult situations, as a result of what we publish!",

      "TRANSCRIPT:\nI have seen this rubbish again and again and again. Let’s pull back and understand what’s going on.\n\nWikiLeaks has published more than ten million documents over ten years. We have a 100% accuracy rate on authenticating our publications. Everyone in the media knows that we have a 100% accuracy rate. Despite our publications affecting powerful groups, which are by definition are connected to the establishment media, this media is in a difficult position. Due to the perfect credibility of our content, ad hominem attacks are used to color perception or create displacement because no direct attack is possible. So, we get all sorts of ad hominem attacks about WikiLeaks, about our sources and about me - i’ve been called a cat torturer, A Mossad agent, CIA agent, a Russian agent now, and a pedophile twice recently on CNN (by the former CIA 2IC).\n\nWikiLeaks has published more than 800,000 documents that relate to Russia or Vladimir Putin. Most of those are critical. More than 2 million are from Syria. We have material from China, we’ve been banned in China, etc. Each country’s establishment tends to perceive WikiLeaks as something that is difficult for them and that erodes the authority of state institutions and that’s true in the United States. \n\nWikiLeaks said it was ready to drop a bombshell on Russia? Not quite, we said we had important document pertaining to Russian corruption and yes, the FSB was apparently quoted as saying that they can electronically attack WikiLeaks. We published regardless. Those were the Russian-related documents in the our diplomatic cables series and they are extremely strong on Chechnya and Russian crime. A number of books were written from that, some calling Russia a mafia state. A number of successful lawsuits against the Russian State have made use of those documents and other documents.\n\nAnother common untruth is the claim that I worked for RT, the Russian State TV. It’s absolutely false. In 2012, we setup a production company and our production company worked with Dartmouth Films, a UK production company and a distributor, Journeyman Pitches, and twelve episodes were filmed of me interviewing people. It was called *The World Tomorrow*. It was my first TV production. We licensed that to a dozen different outfits and RT was one of them. RT aggressively promoted it internationally and then people tried to twist this story into having a \"job\" at RT because they have no arguments about content.\n",

      "TRANSCRIPT:\nMost of it was extremely busy, so just try and conceptualize. \n\nI have been in an embassy siege for the last four and a half years. It’s a small embassy. The embassy is surrounded by a police and intelligence operation, of which there are numerous pictures and admissions by the British state. They admit to spending 4 million pounds a year, just on the covert and overt police surveillance, not including MI5, etc. They have sophisticated robot cameras installed in different buildings, plainclothes police operating on the street and they’ve done deals, of which we have the paperwork, with some of the opposing buildings owned by Harrods, which is a big department store here. Harrods is owned by the sovereign fund of Qatar.\n\nSo, it’s not an easy environment to work in. Spying on the outside, some spying on the inside, informers, robot cameras, etc. \n\nThen during October, there was pressure applied by John Kerry and the US administration and other forms of pressure domestically within Ecuador, that resulted in my Internet connection being cut off and an increase in the security environment here, in terms of people getting in and out of the building easily, etc. It was wrong for John Kerry to politicize the office of the Secretary of State and try to use that for domestic political advantage by pressuring me through my political asylum. WikiLeaks does not publish from the embassy. It doesn’t work from the embassy. I am political refugee stuck in this embassy because the UK refuses to obey international law and respect my asylum rights and let me leave the country. We publish from France, Germany, the Netherlands, and so on, a wide range of countries. But not Ecuador.\n\nEcuador is purely pressured because they are responsible for my physical security as a political refugee. Which is disgraceful. To be fair to Ecuador, they have denied that they were pressured, but that’s not what our sources say. It’s a small country, 16 million people, an innovative, tough Latin American country which has stood up to enormous pressure from the US and UK, but it has it’s own election on February 17th and you can see it wouldn’t want an allegation that it had interfered, which it hasn’t, with the US election, being used as an excuse by Hillary Clinton, who was the predicted president, to interfere with the election in Ecuador.\n\nAn intense security and diplomatic situation. \n\nDuring this recent pressure conspicuously and heavily armed British police arrived, which I took a photo of and which we published, parking their vans right next to the embassy, which they haven’t done, since back in 2012 when the first kind of stand-off was in the embassy. It is a of show of force, presumably to make some kind of pressure for WikiLeaks to stop publishing, but we are setup to continue on regardless of what happens to me.\n\nNo one person in WikiLeaks can become a single point of failure. Why? Because we don’t want to fail, number one. Number two because if that person is perceived to be a single point of failure, it places that person in danger.",
      "TRANSCRIPT:\nEdward Snowden is a whistleblower. He committed an important and brave act, which we supported. I worked with our legal team to get him out of Hong Kong and to a place of asylum. No other media organization did that. Not the Guardian, which had been publishing his material. Nor did Amnesty, human Rights Watch, not even any institution from a government. It was WikiLeaks that acted. A small, investigative publisher, which understands computer security, cryptography, the National Security Agency, which I have been publishing about for more than ten years, and asylum law, because of my situation.\n\nWe couldn't have a situation where Edward Snowden ends up in a position like Chelsea Manning and is used as a general deterrent to other whistleblowers stepping forward. Edward would have been imprisoned at any moment in Hong Kong and would have then been turned into the propaganda that if you’re trying to do something important as a whistleblower, your voice will stopped and you’ll be placed in prison in very adverse conditions.\n\nWe wanted the opposite. We wanted a general incentive for others to step forward. That’s for philosophical reasons, because we understand the threat of mass surveillance, but it’s also understandable for institutional reasons. WikiLeaks specializes in publishing what whistleblowers reveal and if there’s a chill on sources stepping forward, that’s not good for us as an institution. On the other hand, if people see yes, it’s good for sources to step forward, then there will be more of them. \n\nOn full publication versus the sadly limited publication of Snowden files--Edward Snowden hasn’t really had a choice. He has had various views that have shifted over time, but he is in a position where we made sure he had given the documents on him to journalists before he left Hong Kong. Both Edward Snowden and I assessed that it would be a dangerous bait for him to be carrying laptops with NSA material on it, as he transited through Russia to Latin America. That might be something that would cause the Russians to hold him. So he and we made sure he had nothing. Since the point of those initial disclosures, Edward Snowden hasn’t been able to control how his publications have been used.\n\nEdward has been a very important voice in talking about the importance of different aspects of them, but he has had no control. The result is that more than 97% of the Snowden documents have been censored. Enormously important material censored and while there have been some good journalists working on them, and I think Glenn Greenwald is one of the best journalists publishing in the United States, you have to have hundreds of people and engineers working on material like this to understand what is going on.\n\nWe have a different position to those media organizations that have effectively privatized and limited that material. You can’t say that the initial publications had all the important docs. There have been  more publications slowly as time goes by. Even some within the past two months. Those publications, for example, include ways to find interception sites in the United States used by the NSA. There are covert procedures to visiting those sites. Now, if those had been released in 2013, investigative journalists and individuals could have gone to those sites before there was a physical cover-up. That’s true in the United States and it’s true in Europe and elsewhere. I am sad about how the impact of the Snowden archive has been minimized, as a result of privatizing and censoring nearly all of it.\n",

On the other hand, it’s fairly easy for people to constantly repost things that are being censored. ",
      "TRANSCRIPT:\nThat’s an interesting question, but why the irritation? Why the irritation compared to publishing all at once? Critics would say, if we published all at once, that we deliberately made a giant bomb. You deliberately published all at once, in order to have maximum impact.\n\nIn WikiLeaks publications over the last ten years, we have used a variety of publication strategies depending on the amount of material, how readily engaged the audience is, and what the timeframe is for publication. What we have found is that we should closely match the demand curve with the supply curve. Humans can read a limited amount of words each day.\n\nThere is a finite number of people. There’s a finite amount of time. There is a finite reading speed. So, the demand for words, even if an audience is 100% interested in that subject, is finite. It is optimal to match the demand for a particular type of information with the supply of that information. If there’s oversupply of information, above the demand for it, then the oversupplied part is not read and of course, we want our publications to have maximum possible readership understanding. Our sources, of all kinds, want maximum possible impact. They don’t want to go through these risks for their material to not be read.\n\nWe are proud of our election publication strategy. We had limited time and limited resources. Yes, we could have done things slightly differently if we had had more time more staff, etc, but within our resource constraints, we put together I think a pretty kick-ass publishing schedule designed to maximize uptake, readership, engagement, and knowledge extraction from our publications. \n\nThe strategy was designed to be hard to attack. What do I mean by that? Well, in this particular case, we have the Democratic campaign of Hillary Clinton and her associated media allies doing everything they could to spin what we were publishing. I know how this works. If there’s knowledge that WikiLeaks is going to be publishing, say over a month-long period, then a crisis team is set up. We have had a number of these WikiLeaks war rooms and crisis teams setup against us by different governments and companies. From Bank of America to the Pentagon and State Department. They get ready each morning, wait for our publication, and then try to spin it. Insofar as our publications are at all predictable, that spin can be lined up ahead of time and those war rooms can be perfectly resourced. So, we made sure that what we were going to publish was unpredictable, when we were going to publish was unpredictable, how much we were going to publish each day was unpredictable, that we had both a human element looking closely at what was happening on the news and on social media and an algorithm, which also introduced cryptographically secure noise into publication decisions in relation to amounts and timings and making that decision on the fly, not a month ahead of time with a schedule all planned out. Why? Because if we were hacked, we didn’t want, in this case our algorithm, the Stochastic Terminator, its programmatic output to be known in advance because that would permit the Clinton campaign and others to attempt to counter-spin our publications at each moment and we want our publications to be as unspun as possible. \n",

      "TRANSCRIPT:\n\nI have to say that it is a little bit silly. Not in relation to us being under pressure. We have been under a lot of pressure, but we’re very good at resisting pressure. But, in relation to whether I’m alive or kidnapped. If you look at people like John Pilger, for example, long-term friend of mine, runs my defense fund, is a famously brave investigative reporter, my lawyers, close friends, people like Lauri Love, the Ecuadorian government. If you think about the number of people who would actually have to conspire and the amount of work that would have to be done to produce these false images is too many. That’s a social proof. And to understand that, one needs to look at the costs and understand the costs involved in trying to pull together all those people and trying to keep a lid on them and engage in all this kind of fabrication technology, which does not yet exist, as far as anyone can tell, in a capacity to do what is done. To do all that, that’s the cost. And then, but for what benefit? That’s an interesting question.\n\nIn thinking about real-time proof of life, intellectually, the most interesting [method] is to take the most recent block in the blockchain, in the bitcoin blockchain, give the number and at least eight digits or something of the hash and then maybe to spell out this hash by sign language. That’s intellectually entertaining, but what is the problem with it?\n\nWell, let’s see if I can get a recent hash. While it’s intellectually entertaining, the problem with it is this — it’s very complicated, the underlying technology, so it has the same flaw that sophisticated voting machines have, cryptographic voting machines, which is the average person can’t understand whether the security claims are in fact born out. Now experts might be able to, but the average person can’t and so then you’re back to a social proof. Does the average person trust the expert? And then how do they know that those experts are really experts that haven’t been compromised?\n\nSo, in fact, while it’s intellectually entertaining, it’s not at all a good type of proof of currency. But, I’ll give one anyway, so this is block 445706 and the hash is 178374F687728789CAA92ECB49. Ok, I think I made a mistake in the block number, which is going to drive everyone crazy! So, the block number 447506. This is how you can tell it’s real time because of mistakes! Hash 178374F687728789CAA92ECB49. OK, intellectually entertaining.\n\nYou don’t actually have to read out the whole hash number, maybe eight digits or so combined with a block number would be enough to show currency within a ten minute, hour, period, something like that. But the better way to show currency is news that can be widely checked, is widely spread, and is unpredictable before it happens. The best would be a few different natural disasters, maybe a lot of weather measurements, and otherwise need something that’s not easily predicted and which can be widely checked or widely seen at the time. And a good example of that is sports scores. \n\nFor example, the New Orlean Pelicans versus the NY Knicks won 110-96, Oklahoma 109 versus 94 Chicago, Dallas 92 versus 101 for Minnesota. So, that can give you currency.\n\nIn terms of any future precedent, if I disappear or someone else disappears, the answer to if we are OK or under duress should be given by two things in future: Number one by lawyers, publicly associated close friends, people who fund my defense campaign. So, let’s look at those. John Pilger, The Courage Foundation, people associated with it, my lawyers, such as Jennifer Robinson, Margaret Ratner in the United States, Melinda Taylor.\n\nAnd [number two] the ability to do live interactive video, where someone, even though theoretically they could be under duress, can interject in the stream quickly to say such a thing or to give a variety of messages in a live way, which each one is not comprehensible at the time that is said, but the last one, if you like, provides the conceptual key to decrypt them. (I am not doing this now! I am not doing this now!).\n\nI very much appreciate the support. It had some good effects. I think it probably contributed significantly to restoring my Internet. \n\nBut a lot of that well-intentioned support was waylaid by a black PR campaign, so don’t let that happen again. And, that’s it. Thank you, Reddit. Thank you, Redditors, for spending so much time on our material. We are really, really happy with it. Thanks. ",
      "TRANSCRIPT:\nI can’t confirm or deny anything relating to our sources there. However, yes, there is a disappeared video and that video is on the Garani massacre. Over 80 children killed in a US airstrike in Afghanistan and more than 100 people. Quite a serious video and if you search for ‘Assange Affidavit’, you read an affidavit about how Sweden conducted an intelligence operation on September 27, 2010 to seize three laptops, not the high security laptops, but backup laptops, that were encrypted that ended up being the only copy we had of that video. We had other copies and they were also attacked. So, that’s a great sadness from us that this terrible proof of a war crime has been possibly lost to history, as a result of very difficult attacks on us. It’s something that we’re a lot less susceptible to now because we have a big infrastructure. \n",

      "TRANSCRIPT:\nIt’s a statement, really. An extremely irritating statement. It’s so 21st century, so Generation Z, so millennial. It’s not about you. It’s not about whether you have something to hide. It’s about whether society can function and what sort of society it is. The key actors in society who influence its political process: publishers, journalists, dissidents, MPs, civil society foundations, if they can’t operate then you have an increasingly authoritarian and conformist society. Do not think that this will not affect you. Even if you think that you are of absolutely no interest, the result this attitude is that you have to suffer the consequences of the society your apathetic conformism helps to produce.\n\nYou’re not an island. When you don’t protect your own communications, it’s not just about you. You’re not communicating with yourself, you’re communicating with other people. You’re exposing all of those other people. If you assess that they’re not at risk, are you sure your assessment is correct? Are you sure they’re not at risk going into the future? Perhaps the biggest problem with mass surveillance is that the knowledge of mass surveillance. Fear about it produces intense conformity, so people start censoring their own conversations and eventually they start censoring their own thoughts. \n\nIt’s not enough to create fears about mass surveillance. At the same time, one has to create an understanding of how to avoid mass surveillance or an understanding that at the moment, most of the mass surveillance authorities, like the NSA and the organs it feeds are pretty incompetent. But that will change as artificial intelligence merges with mass surveillance, when the data streams from the NSA and PRISM program are fed into artificial intelligence.",

      "TRANSCRIPT: \nNo, of course, we didn’t. It is a false story. WikiLeaks never posted any such thing on Twitter. The primary WikiLeaks support group, WikiLeaks Task Force, said it was \"thinking\" about creating what data points are needed to create a map of predictors to understand the influence relationships between people who are involved in influencing on Twitter.\n\nVerified users are influential, who influences those users? But that’s a discussion question by a support group who explicitly stated that it’s not about publishing addresses.\n\nBut why is that story spreading? It’s spreading because of two reasons. Number one, as a result of the efficacy of our publications and their perceived damage to the US ruling class, there’s a desire to reduce our reputation in the establishment press, so such Tweets are grabbed onto, re-assigned, taken out of context, and promoted. I also see a second reason, which is interesting. Is there exists a two-level class hierarchy on Twitter. People with blue ticks and people without blue ticks. There’s about 230,000 users with blue ticks and they correspond with something like about 30% of people who would consider themselves members of the establishment in English speaking countries. Those are MPs, journalists, CEOs, etc. People who are representatives in some way and therefore have a need to interface with the public. About a third of those types, in particular, the upcoming ones, are on Twitter and they have blue ticks. So you have here both an identity phenomenon (where someone is branded with an identity of a blue tick and so an identity politics is emerging within this group) and also a class phenomenon. The recontextualization of the WikiLeaks Task Force discussion point into a threat against this identity group was then widely spread by self same identity group which also lined up fairly neatly with the \"liberal\" establishment politics of something like 80% of that identity group.\n\nThink about this new emerging identity class. It has a quality. Within the blue tick class that is you have a blue tick or you don’t. So metrics looking at what the relationships are between people in the blue tick identity class and exterior (of Twitter) class dynamics, relationships to power of various kinds, removes some part of the equalitarian nature within the blue tick identity class, which can be seen a a threat to those people who have gained the blue tick, but are otherwise not in power in the exterior class. It’s interesting. \n",

      "TRANSCRIPT:\nThere’s a claim repeated by the usual idiots in the ruling class press that WikiLeaks said the Panama Papers had been produced by the CIA US intelligence to attack Vladimir Putin. Absolutely not. In fact, we explicitly stated that we did not believe that was so. The key journalist and newspapers who collected the Panama Papers in Germany are our publishing partners, so we knew about the story. We aggressively promoted it. However, the particular story that came out on Vladimir Putin, which was pushed as the leading story in the Western press, rather than issues relating to say David Cameron or Western figures coming out of the Panama Papers, was funded by USAID and Soros Foundation. They funded an organization called OOCPR, which does sometimes good work, but is based in Maryland and focusses exclusively on negative stories about Russia and the former Soviet states. So, you have a story on Vladimir Putin produced by an organization, which exclusively focuses on Russia and the former Soviet states that is based in Maryland and is funded, the only funders listed, by USAID and the Soros Foundation. That is no model for integrity. And that’s what we said. Some good journalism, but this is a difficulty when you have negative stories about Putin being pushed forward and funded by the US government.

      "Edward Snowden has said that he was inspired by Chelsea Manning. The US government wanted to publically destroy Manning, in a grotesque way, as a warning. They did not succeed but I realised we can do even better! This is part of the reason why we put a lot of resources and risk into getting Edward Snowden asylum. He is now mostly free, living a forfilling life of respect, an inspirational symbol for whistleblowers world wide and not a general deterrant suffering in a US prison unable to defend himself or promote his cause in public.\n\nHere's what I wrote about Manning as his trial started. These words are still true:\n\nAs I type these lines, on June 3, 2013, Private First Class Bradley Edward Manning is being tried in a sequestered room at Fort Meade, Maryland, for the alleged crime of telling the truth. The court martial of the most prominent political prisoner in modern US history has now, finally, begun.\n\nIt has been three years. Bradley Manning, then 22 years old, was arrested in Baghdad on May 26, 2010. He was shipped to Kuwait, placed into a cage, and kept in the sweltering heat of Camp Arifjan.\n\n\"For me, I stopped keeping track,\" he told the court last November. \"I didn’t know whether night was day or day was night. And my world became very, very small. It became these cages... I remember thinking I’m going to die.\"\n\nAfter protests from his lawyers, Bradley Manning was then transferred to a brig at a US Marine Corps Base in Quantico, VA, where - infamously - he was subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment at the hands of his captors - a formal finding by the UN. Isolated in a tiny cell for twenty-three out of twenty-four hours a day, he was deprived of his glasses, sleep, blankets and clothes, and prevented from exercising. All of this - it has been determined by a military judge - \"punished\" him before he had even stood trial.\n\n\"Brad’s treatment at Quantico will forever be etched, I believe, in our nation’s history, as a disgraceful moment in time\" said his lawyer, David Coombs. \"Not only was it stupid and counterproductive, it was criminal.\"\n\nThe United States was, in theory, a nation of laws. But it is no longer a nation of laws for Bradley Manning.\n\nWhen the abuse of Bradley Manning became a scandal reaching all the way to the President of the United States and Hillary Clinton’s spokesman resigned to register his dissent over Mr. Manning’s treatment, an attempt was made to make the problem less visible. Bradley Manning was transferred to the Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nHe has waited in prison for three years for a trial - 986 days longer than the legal maximum - because for three years the prosecution has dragged its feet and obstructed the court, denied the defense access to evidence and abused official secrecy. This is simply illegal - all defendants are constitutionally entitled to a speedy trial - but the transgression has been acknowledged and then overlooked.\n\nAgainst all of this, it would be tempting to look on the eventual commencement of his trial as a mercy. But that is hard to do.\n\nWe no longer need to comprehend the \"Kafkaesque\" through the lens of fiction or allegory. It has left the pages and lives among us, stalking our best and brightest. It is fair to call what is happening to Bradley Manning a \"show trial\". Those invested in what is called the \"US military justice system\" feel obliged to defend what is going on, but the rest of us are free to describe this travesty for what it is. No serious commentator has any confidence in a benign outcome. The pretrial hearings have comprehensively eliminated any meaningful uncertainty, inflicting pre-emptive bans on every defense argument that had any chance of success.\n\nBradley Manning may not give evidence as to his stated intent (exposing war crimes and their context), nor may he present any witness or document that shows that no harm resulted from his actions. Imagine you were put on trial for murder. In Bradley Manning’s court, you would be banned from showing that it was a matter of self-defence, because any argument or evidence as to intent is banned. You would not be able to show that the ’victim’ is, in fact, still alive, because that would be evidence as to the lack of harm.\n\nBut of course. Did you forget whose show it is?\n\nThe government has prepared for a good show. The trial is to proceed for twelve straight weeks: a fully choreographed extravaganza, with a 141-strong cast of prosecution witnesses. The defense was denied permission to call all but a handful of witnesses. Three weeks ago, in closed session, the court actually held a rehearsal. Even experts on military law have called this unprecedented.\n\nBradley Manning’s conviction is already written into the script. The commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces, Barack Obama, spoiled the plot for all of us when he pronounced Bradley Manning guilty two years ago. \"He broke the law,\" President Obama stated, when asked on camera at a fundraiser about his position on Mr. Manning. In a civilized society, such a prejudicial statement alone would have resulted in a mistrial.\n\nTo convict Bradley Manning, it will be necessary for the US government to conceal crucial parts of his trial. Key portions of the trial are to be conducted in secrecy: 24 prosecution witnesses will give secret testimony in closed session, permitting the judge to claim that secret evidence justifies her decision. But closed justice is no justice at all.\n\nWhat cannot be shrouded in secrecy will be hidden through obfuscation. The remote situation of the courtroom, the arbitrary and discretionary restrictions on access for journalists, and the deliberate complexity and scale of the case are all designed to drive fact-hungry reporters into the arms of official military PR men, who mill around the Fort Meade press room like over-eager sales assistants. The management of Bradley Manning’s case will not stop at the limits of the courtroom. It has already been revealed that the Pentagon is closely monitoring press coverage and social media discussions on the case.\n\nThis is not justice; never could this be justice. The verdict was ordained long ago. Its function is not to determine questions such as guilt or innocence, or truth or falsehood. It is a public relations exercise, designed to provide the government with an alibi for posterity. It is a show of wasteful vengeance; a theatrical warning to people of conscience.\n\nThe alleged act in respect of which Bradley Manning is charged is an act of great conscience - the single most important disclosure of subjugated history, ever. There is not a political system anywhere on the earth that has not seen light as a result. In court, in February, Bradley Manning said that he wanted to expose injustice, and to provoke worldwide debate and reform. Bradley Manning is accused of being a whistleblower, a good man, who cared for others and who followed higher orders. Bradley Manning is effectively accused of conspiracy to commit journalism.\n\nBut this is not the language the prosecution uses. The most serious charge against Bradley Manning is that he \"aided the enemy\" - a capital offence that should require the greatest gravity, but here the US government laughs at the world, to breathe life into a phantom. The government argues that Bradley Manning communicated with a media organisation, WikiLeaks, who communicated to the public. It also argues that al-Qaeda (who else) is a member of the public. Hence, it argues that Bradley Manning communicated \"indirectly\" with al-Qaeda, a formally declared US \"enemy\", and therefore that Bradley Manning communicated with \"the enemy\".\n\nBut what about \"aiding\" in that most serious charge, \"aiding the enemy\"? Don’t forget that this is a show trial. The court has banned any evidence of intent. The court has banned any evidence of the outcome, the lack of harm, the lack of any victim. It has ruled that the government doesn’t need to show that any \"aiding\" occurred and the prosecution doesn’t claim it did. The judge has stated that it is enough for the prosecution to show that al-Qaeda, like the rest of the world, reads WikiLeaks.\n\n“Liberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people,\" wrote John Adams, \"who have a right and a desire to know.”\n\nWhen communicating with the press is \"aiding the enemy\" it is the \"general knowledge among the people\" itself which has become criminal. Just as Bradley Manning is condemned, so too is that spirit of liberty in which America was founded.\n\nIn the end it is not Bradley Manning who is on trial. His trial ended long ago. The defendent now, and for the next 12 weeks, is the United States. A runaway military, whose misdeeds have been laid bare, and a secretive government at war with the public. They sit in the docks. We are called to serve as jurists. We must not turn away.",

OR Books, New York, 2012, 186 pages, Paper. Buy online. Cryptome review of the book.\n\nPages 1-7.\n\nINTRODUCTION: A CALL TO CRYPTOGRAPHIC ARMS\n\nThis book is not a manifesto. There is not time for that. This book is a warning.\n\nThe world is not sliding, but galloping into a new transnational dystopia. This development has not been properly recognized outside of national security circles. It has been hidden by secrecy, complexity and scale. The internet, our greatest tool of emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen. The internet is a threat to human civilization.\n\nThese transformations have come about silently, because those who know what is going on work in the global surveillance industry and have no incentives to speak out. Left to its own trajectory, within a few years, global civilization will be a postmodern surveillance dystopia, from which escape for all but the most skilled individuals will be impossible. In fact, we may already be there.\n\nWhile many writers have considered what the internet means for global civilization, they are wrong. They are wrong because they do not have the sense of perspective that direct experience brings. They are wrong because they have never met the enemy.\n\nNo description of the world survives first contact with the enemy.\n\nWe have met the enemy.\n\nOver the last six years WikiLeaks has had conflicts with nearly every powerful state. We know the new surveillance state from an insider's perspective, because we have plumbed its secrets. We know it from a combatant's perspective, because we have had to protect our people, our finances and our sources from it. We know it from a global perspective, because we have people, assets and information in nearly every country. We know it from the perspective of time, because we have been fighting this phenomenon for years and have seen it double and spread, again and again. It is an invasive parasite, growing fat off societies that merge with the internet. It is rolling over the planet, infecting all states and peoples before it.\n[..]\n\nDoes it even make sense to ask this question? In this otherworldly space, this seemingly platonic realm of ideas and information flow, could there be a notion of coercive force? A force that could modify historical records, tap phones, separate people, transform complexity into rubble, and erect walls, like an occupying army?\n\nThe platonic nature of the internet, ideas and information flows, is debased by its physical origins. Its foundations are fiber optic cable lines stretching across the ocean floors, satellites spinning above our heads, computer servers housed in buildings in cities from New York to Nairobi. Like the soldier who slew Archimedes with a mere sword, so too could an armed militia take control of the peak development of Western civilization, our platonic realm.\n\nThe new world of the internet, abstracted from the old world of brute atoms, longed for independence. But states and their friends moved to control our new world -- by controlling its physical underpinnings. The state, like an army around an oil well, or a customs agent extracting bribes at the border, would soon learn to leverage its control of physical space to gain control over our platonic realm. It would prevent the independence we had dreamed of, and then, squatting on fiber optic lines and around satellite ground stations, it would go on to mass intercept the information flow of our new world -- its very essence even as every human, economic, and political relationship embraced it. The state would leech into the veins and arteries of our new societies, gobbling up every relationship expressed or communicated, every web page read, every message sent and every thought googled, and then store this knowledge, billions of interceptions a day, undreamed of power, in vast top secret warehouses, forever. It would go on to mine and mine again this treasure, the collective private intellectual output of humanity, with ever more sophisticated search and pattern finding algorithms, enriching the treasure and maximizing the power imbalance between interceptors and the world of interceptees. And then the state would reflect what it had learned back into the physical world, to start wars, to target drones, to manipulate UN committees and trade deals, and to do favors for its vast connected network of industries, insiders and cronies.\n\nBut we discovered something. Our one hope against total domination. A hope that with courage, insight and solidarity we could use to resist. A strange property of the physical universe that we live in.\n\nThe universe believes in encryption.\n\nIt is easier to encrypt information than it is to decrypt it.\n\nWe saw we could use this strange property to create the laws of a new world. To abstract away our new platonic realm from its base underpinnings of satellites, undersea cables and their controllers. To fortify our space behind a cryptographic veil. To create new lands barred to those who control physical reality, because to follow us into them would require infinite resources.\n\nAnd in this manner to declare independence.\n\nScientists in the Manhattan Project discovered that the universe permitted the construction of a nuclear bomb. This was not an obvious conclusion. Perhaps nuclear weapons were not within the laws of physics. However, the universe believes in atomic bombs and nuclear reactors. They are a phenomenon the universe blesses, like salt, sea or stars.\n\nSimilarly, the universe, our physical universe, has that property that makes it possible for an individual or a group of individuals to reliably, automatically, even without knowing, encipher something, so that all the resources and all the political will of the strongest superpower on earth may not decipher it. And the paths of encipherment between people can mesh together to create regions free from the coercive force of the outer state. Free from mass interception. Free from state control.\n\nIn this way, people can oppose their will to that of a fully mobilized superpower and win. Encryption is an embodiment of the laws of physics, and it does not listen to the bluster of states, even transnational surveillance dystopias.\n\nIt isn't obvious that the world had to work this way. But somehow the universe smiles on encryption.\n\nCryptography is the ultimate form of non-violent direct action. While nuclear weapons states can exert unlimited violence over even millions of individuals, strong cryptography means that a state, even by exercising unlimited violence, cannot violate the intent of individuals to keep secrets from them.\n\nStrong cryptography can resist an unlimited application of violence. No amount of coercive force will ever solve a math problem.\n\nBut could we take this strange fact about the world and build it up to be a basic emancipatory building block for the independence of mankind in the platonic realm of the internet? And as societies merged with the internet could that liberty then be reflected back into physical reality to redefine the state?\n\nRecall that states are the systems which determine where and how coercive force is consistently applied.\n\nThe question of how much coercive force can seep into the platonic realm of the internet from the physical world is answered by cryptography and the cypherpunks' ideals.\n\nAs states merge with the internet and the future of our civilization becomes the future of the internet, we must redefine force relations.\n\nIf we do not, the universality of the internet will merge global humanity into one giant grid of mass surveillance and mass control.\n\nWe must raise an alarm. This book is a watchman's shout in the night.\n\nOn March 20, 2012, while under house arrest in the United Kingdom awaiting extradition, I met with three friends and fellow watchmen on the principle that perhaps in unison our voices can wake up the town. We must communicate what we have learned while there is still a chance for you, the reader, to understand and act on what is happening.\n\nIt is time to take up the arms of our new world, to fight for ourselves and for those we love.\n\nOur task is to secure self-determination where we can, to hold back the coming dystopia where we cannot, and if all else fails, to accelerate its self-destruction.\n\n-- Julian Assange, London, October 2012 \n\nhttp://cryptome.xxx/2012/12/assange-wl-arms-xxx.htm",

      "Yeah, so that article was sent to me. I might be the first person for whom a trillion movie dollars was spent to rescue, so obviously that will be a milestone, and I am actively looking for projects that could cost people money trying to come get me. Thank you.\n\n- How would you celebrate passing it?\n\nI think a big Reddit party would be the way to go.",
      "Thank you. *Good Will Hunting* obviously is the most influential movie in my life, and in Ben's life, and bringing it to the screen kind of dominated our 20s. It took 5 years to get it from the time we started to the time it came out, it took 5 years. So I would love to write another script with Ben; I love Ben, I love his work, he's been my buddy for 35 years. The big issue is time for us. We have a company together so we work on a lot of projects together, but to try to carve out the time is really tough. I mean we both have a whole mess of kids now, and these other days jobs. He's directing all the time and I'm off working with these other directors. The thing about *Good Will Hunting* is that we were unemployed and we weren't writing the script on a deadline either. Nobody was expecting it, so we were just these two idiots in our basement writing this thing, and now we have all of these pressures of the lives grownups have. So I would never say never because I would absolutely love to write with Ben again, and I'd love to collaborate with him on anything, he's brilliant. I'd love to be in one of his movies that he directs. The problem there is that he just keeps giving himself the best roles, so until he stops doing that and maybe just directs, none of us can really work with him.",
      "That's a great question. The thing about acting is often time what happens is you end up being a jack of all trades and a master of none. So I've had to learn things for the *Bourne* films for instance, like being upside down underwater in a car which required me to learn. I went to a swimming pool in Berlin everyday after work and practiced being at the bottom with a scuba tank, getting my air taken away, and tying shoes and doing small menial activities without my air in order to be comfortable underwater so I could shoot that scene. I didn't walk away being certified as a scuba diver which would probably be a better use of my time, but I walked away being able to be in a car underwater and perform the scene I needed to performed, so it's an odd set of skills you end up learning. Though I did for the Bourne movies start boxing and I never did that before, I was 29 and I fell in love with doing it. I never did it as a sport. I wouldn't put me as a ring against anyone. I'm an excellent movie fighter, probably wouldn't be in a real fight. ",
      "Thank you! I was always kind of bewildered by *Team America*, I think because it's hard for us to understand what our images are in public, I think we're not good judges of that, and when I saw myself on screen just only able to say my own name and not really that well, I kind of wondered \"Wow, is that how people perceive me?\" At that point I just kind of was like, I'm a screenwriter and an actor, and like really? I can barely say my own name? So I was always bewildered by that, and I never talked to Trey and Matt about that. And Incidentally, I believe those two are geniuses, and I don't use that word lightly. I think they are absolute geniuses, and what they've done is awesome and I'm a big fan of theirs, but I never quite understood that one. But I will say this. Those of us who were parodied in that video were parodied because we were against the Iraq war, and we went on the record against that war, and so history is on my side not theirs.",
      "First of all, why does your costume look like it cost more then mine in the martian? That's an awesome costume and I agree you do. I'm glad that I make halloween easier for you. Working with Robin almost defies description. He was one of the most generous, \nloving, wonderful people I've ever met. He had this capacity that I've never seen on a movie set. When everyone started to get tired and started to flag a little bit, he would launch into standup. We knew it was original  because he was making fun of crew members and pulling them into these bits. It was like 15 minutes of the best stand-up ever that was just privately for us. Everyone would laugh and laugh and laugh and then everybody would get this boost of energy and go back to work. I'll never be able to thank him enough for what he gave us. In my heart, that's where he is, as this person that I'm deeply deeply grateful came into my life and changed it for the better. ",
      "That's a good question and I don't think there's a uniform answer. Now at this point of my career it's usually less about the script and more about who the director is, but in the case of a movie like *The Martian* I read the script and I thought it was incredible, but I also thought it was really risky because for my portion of the movie it was just going to be me up there, and when Drew Goddard who wrote the script backed out of directing it because he got another job there was no director attached, and so I just walked away from the script. I just said it's too risky, I wouldn't let just anybody did this. And then when Ridley Scott said that he liked it, the decision took me all half a second. So the script is obviously important, but it's more so about the director.\n\nThe ingredients of my ideal taco, oh my god. Fantastic question. My ideal taco is actually the taco I'm not supposed to have which is the taco we have on taco night at my house. It's the crunchy corn shell with the good meat, just ground beef in there. It's all about the layering. The meats gotta be hot, and the cheese goes on first so that it melts. And then you're gonna get in there with a little bit of tomato and lettuce but not too much cause it's not a salad, it's a taco, and then you're gonna throw some avocado on top and some sour cream and then a bunch of cholula. I don't know if you know what cholula hot sauce is but it's the best. Throw a bunch of cholula on there, maybe squeeze some lime on top, and go to town. ",
      "I think the best thing a director can do is create an environment, a really open and free environment, and I have to say that I worked with some of the best directors on the planet, and they all do it differently, but the one quality that they all share is that the great ones all create a really highly collaborative environment where it's basically a battlefield of ideas. The ego is completely checked at the door, so they don't show up with this is the way it's going to go. I mean director is kind of the wrong word for what they're doing. They don't say I'm directing you to do this and this is the only way it's going to go. They show up with an idea that is their best idea, and then they're open to everybody else's idea and then they're willing to instantly jettison their own idea if faced with a better one. So they're essentially the arbiter of taste, but they create an environment where everyone feels free to lob ideas at them, and that's how people start iterating on each other's ideas and that's collaboration, the best ideas emerges. \n\nIt's been interesting to me over 20 years to look at these master directors, the people who would be commonly perceived as master directors and realize they're allegiance is to what they're making and not their own ego.",
      "Happiness. ",
      "He just did one literally last week. I got these giant fruit baskets in the mail from Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. They had just made jokes at everyone's expense at the Golden Globes that were really funny. George made up stationary with my name on it, and sent a really wounded letter to Tina and Amy saying my feelings were really hurt, how could they do this, etc.  So they sent two fruit baskets. One had a letter with an apology. Another said “If this is part of some Clooney prank, please know that we’re grown-ass comedians, and you have to do a little better to fool us.” So I photographed the letters and emailed them to George with a caption that said “Go fuck yourself.” He’s honestly a child. I can just see his shoulders shaking when he laughs alone in his house. ",
      "I thought it was brilliant! I mean, I never understood it, and then I heard an interview with them and they said the puppet came in looking kind of mentally deficient and they didn’t have time to change it, so they just made me someone who could really only say his own name. All the comedy they’re doing is really next-level stuff. Also, I liked being included as a person who was against the Iraq war.",
      "So *EuroTrip* was written by three guys I went to college with, Alec Shaffer, Jeff Berg, and Dave Mandell. And the three of them are three of the best comedy writers in the world. In fact, Alec and Jeff when we moved out to LA, we had this running joke where we had one bottle of champagne that I think they sent to us when we sold *Good Will Hunting*, or no, we sent it to them first because they had been hired on *Seinfeld*, so we would pass this bottle back and forth, we never opened it, but it was just to congratulate each other at these milestone moments in our careers. So we kind of came up together. I was in Prague shooting *The Brothers Grimm*, we were in rehearsals, and I had a wig in that movie, and so Alec and Dave and Jeff were making *EuroTrip* and they said \"Will you come play this, you know, Howard Rollins kind of insane, bad version of a suburban, you know, punk band guy?\" And I said \"Yea, I'm in Prague\".  So I showed up and I'm sitting there, and I'm like \"I'm wearing a wig, just shave my head, let’s just go for it.\" and we did it, and put a bunch of piercings all over. And \"Scotty Doesn't Know\", the song, was actually written by one of my college roommates brothers, and in the band, one of my college roommates is actually in that back up band, Jason, is playing guitar in that group. So it was kind of a family affair. \n\nIt's tough to choose, like between films you've been in. I don't think I'm the best objective judge of any of those films. I mean *Private Ryan* was obviously the most significant in my life because it was right when my career was starting and it came out right after *Good Will Hunting*, and it did a lot to kind of position me, you know, as an actor that a studio would take a chance on. So that was probably the most influential on my life. I haven't seen the movie in a long time, I remember loving it and being deeply grateful that I was in it, and thinking that Steven was really at the top of his game, as was Tom. So that movie was always, you know I think of *Interstellar* and *The Martian* as things I made in my 40s. My life is very different, so I almost couldn't categorize those three movies. I wouldn't put them into the same basket.",
      "Thank you, and I'm glad I'm your favorite actor. You have my favorite user name of anybody I've ever seen. It was an easy decision. Once Paul Greengrass said he wanted to do it, I was in, but we didn't have a story. I mean it was nine years in the making because we didn't want to force it if it wasn't there, and so once we realized it was there we all jumped on board, but before that it was an agonizing process as we tried to figure out if there even was a story to tell. ",
      "Definitely pimp slapping a knife wielding assassin. That's kind of the first thing, you know--it has absolutely no relation to my actual life, but I get to do it when I play Jason Bourne. So you know I think the people who make these movies with me, and there's you know, a couple hundred of us and we've worked on these movies for years. We love this franchise as much as you guys do, so I think your question was funny but those moments of originality in those fight scenes, I mean that's kind of what we geek out on and we try to think of ways to incorporate that fun fighting style where Bourne is finding found objects and defending himself with them, and in many ways he's the opposite of James Bond. Where James Bond always has the right gadget, Jason Bourne never does, so he's got to just improvise. ",
      "I think the best advice I was given--well, I'd say two things. When I was younger, everybody told me not to be an actor, and to this day I say that to people who come up to me and say \"I'm thinking of going into acting, what do you think?\" I say \"Absolutely not, it's a terrible idea, don't do it.\" because that's what everybody said to me, and I think that if you're gonna make it in this business that is so full of rejection and hardship, you need to believe in yourself despite what everybody you love and trust tells you. And it's a very personal journey, so that was very helpful. I think, you know, the advice to stay away from this career was really helpful in my own understanding that it was that important that I pursue it. The other advice that I would say, my high school acting teacher Gerry Speca had a huge influence on me and Ben and Casey. Five words he said \"Just do your work, kid.\" and he repeated that so many times to me \"Just do your work, kid.\" and that is kind of what I can always retreat to. That's my touchstone if, when in doubt, just focus on my work. If everything on the movie is going wrong, alright, I'll make sure that my work is tight and go from there. And that's a great place to base from, and that's a good foundation. ",

      "Well, the  first thing to that monologue is it’s safe to say that is the hardest that Ben and I have ever laughed while writing something. We were in our old house in Hollywood, in the basement of this house writing this thing and we were literally in tears because this monologue kept building on itself. We wrote it it one night and kept performing it back and forth, and pissing ourselves laughing. \n\nYou know, I was unaware, as I think everyone was, that they had that capacity. Snowden is literally changing policy. These are conversations we have to have about our security, and civil liberties, and we have to decide what we are willing to accept, and he’s provided a huge service kickstarting that debate.",

      "I've never considered a hot dog a sandwich because a hot dog is a hot dog.

      "I spoke to them at a rally for public school teachers a few years ago.  My mom’s a professor and she’s become increasingly concerned, as have a lot of teachers, about the way policy is being designed in this country. It’s being designed by a bunch of people who aren’t teachers.  They talk about accountability, but they’re measuring with these standardized tests, which I believe in my heart they will start fading out.  It just demonstrably does not work. No Child Left Behind does not work. I’ve always believed that they have to invite teachers into the discussion to help design policy. We would never let business men design warheads, why would you cut out educators when you’re designing education policy? This was for one of those libertarian websites and they had an attack question planned about tenure. Diane Ravitch was there, she’s a huge figure in education and she jumped in and just set them straight about what having tenure meant.  It just basically means you have the right to be represented, and have your side of something heard if someone is trying to get rid of you. But in terms of education policy, I think that far too much emphasis has been put on these tests. You’re going to get teachers teaching to the test and you’re not actually giving them the leeway to do their jobs. People get tired of hearing about Finland, but they do it better than anyone, and when you look at how, it’s very simple.  They have very highly trained teachers. 50% of teachers here quit within 5 years.  We just send these kids to these 6 week Teach for America training courses and expect them to perform well. In Finland, 1 out of 10 people get into these teaching colleges. You have to go through the entire program and come out with a Masters, and then you’re put in room with another teacher and a class size no bigger than 20.  It’s highly regarded, people don’t quit.  Finland kicks our ass on any metric. They keep the class size down, they’re aggressive about confronting poverty.  We have the resources here it’s just whether we’re willing to focus on it. ",
      "Thank you for the question. The experience of founding water.org. What really happened was once I Identified water and sanitation as the area that I wanted to focus on, and that was a whole process that Bono's group DATA was really helpful with. They organized a trip for me to study extreme poverty and I went to Africa for a couple of weeks and looked at all these different things. Water and sanitation was what really spoke to me, I felt like it understood everything and I really wanted to focus there. I think what a lot of people do, I just said I'll raise money for well projects, what we would call direct impact projects. I felt like with my name I could use whatever influence I had to direct money to good places. Then as I learned more and more about it and the deeply complex nature of the issues. I felt like I could maximize my impact more if I partnered with the preeminent expert in the space, somebody who I would be lucky to partner with, quite frankly. That's what led me to Gary White. I asked him and he said yes, the rest is history. That was in 2009. To date, actually we just got the numbers in recently, we have delivered water and sanitization solutions to 4.6 million people. That number is growing exponentially because of our system of water credit. It's using the concepts of micro-finance that Mohamed Eunice pioneered and applying them to the water sector. What's great about it is our loans are paying back at over 99% and that money just gets recycled. It's this virtuous circle. Rather than spending $25 to do a well project and give someone clean water for life, in our most mature loan programs we are down to about $5 per person. That system has driven down the philanthropic cost of capital per person substantially. Thank you for your question.",

      "I think the most challenging role that I've ever had, was when I did *Courage Under Fire* and I had to lose all the weight that I lost on my own, that was the most physically challenging did I've ever had to do in my life. I weigh probably 190 pounds right now, and I weighed 139 in that movie, and that is not a natural weight for me and not a happy weight for me even when I was 25. So you know to do that I had to run about 13 miles a day which wasn't even the hard part. The hard part was the diet, all I ate was chicken breast.

      "For most films you take a pay cut, especially if you’re working with an ensemble. They just can’t pay what everyone’s quote is, because the movie would be too cumbersome and no one could make it.  I’ve done that with all of the Ocean’s movies. You have an established quote, and the studio decides what percentage everyone takes. So everyone cuts the same percentage of their agreed upon salary.  Actually, I think the only time I got my full quote was for the 3rd Bourne movie. ",

Growing up with him, he's 5 years younger than me, he's kind of like a little brother to me, but watching his work develop over the years has been really fun. There's a movie that I produced that's coming out called Manchester by the Sea. I'm as proud of that as anything I've ever been a part of.

I can’t make it too easy for my kids because that doesn’t really equip them to handle the world when I’m not around. Anytime you deal with death, anytime in my life on a personal level that I’ve lost someone, that’s always a moment to grieve and feel incredibly thankful that I’m still here and I’m still able to have my family around me.

I used to get on my bike, and my mother actually sewed blue lines down a pair of chinos that I had so that I could have the tan pants with the blue lines that the California highway patrol, and get on my Huffy and ride around the neighborhood.",
      "I think my favorite place to eat in the city is my mother’s house. But for places that you could go, I’d say Legal Seafood is always a great spot to hit. \n\nIn terms of advice - it’s tough. The business is growing more accessible because technology is more available to people than when we started you had to shoot on film and it was very hard to get a movie made, and now kids are starting to have access to cameras at a much earlier age. In terms of breaking into the business there’s no set way to do it, you have to somehow make a movie and get it out there. In Ben and my case we wrote a movie because we were struggling to get a job. We wrote jobs for ourselves. We wrote Robin William’s character, we called it the Harvey Keitel part, because with Reservoir Dogs Harvey read his part and liked it, and that how they got funding. So we knew that was that character for us. There were so were so many ways to play that character, we were casting a wide net and just hoping to we caught a big fish, and our agent Patrick, who’s still our agent, forced him to read it and he loved it. He kicked it up to the lit department, and then we had lit agents. So we got lucky, but it’s just looking for creative ways to break in. If you just sit on your hands it’s never gonna happen, its just too competitive. Jobs are available, you have to go make your own. ",
      "I've never been approached to do that, I'd totally be into it. I'm really interested to see where entertainment heads as these video games, the graphic are getting so good, and VR is getting so good, and you know, what's going to happen to movies? What are the implications for movies, and does this morph into a new kind of story telling, and what is that, and can I be a part of it? You know, ultimately those of us who make movies are storytellers and we want to gather you around and tell you stories. If gaming is the way to do that I'm all for looking into it, but nobody has asked me as of yet.",
      "I think I’d go with 100 duck-sized horses.  I just don’t know how lethal a horse-sized duck could be.  I don’t know enough about it to understand what issues would be at play in a battle like that. Whereas with the horses, it’s not like fighting 10 duck sized jaguars, which would scare the shit out of me because it would be like death by a thousand cuts. I don’t feel like the horse is going to spin around and kick me.  And you can also climb a tree.  But a duck could fly and just take you out in the tree. \n\nThis would be a great interview question by the way.",
      "Will he direct me or will he give me a job? I love Kevin, I love working with him. He’s awesome. I wish he directed more, but I think he’s retired. ",
      "Well, Ben is a lot bigger than those guys. He’s hopelessly uncoordinated, but he is a big dude with a huge reach advantage. Edward is smart though, so he might think of some brainiac survivor way to pit the others against each other and be the last remaining man. \n\nLeo… I’m not counting Leo out. I’m just saying I don’t know about Leo. Anyway, Wahlberg would kill all of them.",
      "Thanks for these questions. I addressed the first two in other answers. But to the third question, I have many times. My initial connection to the issue resulted from a trip for a different purpose that eventually led me to co-founding Water.org.  In 2006, I went on a field trip that was set up by Bono’s organization, which was an incredible opportunity, a chance to go to Africa (Zambia and South Africa), and learn about issues of extreme poverty.  Each day had a different learning focus. One day we’d be doing urban AIDS and be in AIDS clinics in Johannesburg.  The trip was probably a week or 10 days, and one of the learning focus days was water.  \n\nI think as I looked at it and started to grasp the enormity of the issue, it seemed like water underpinned everything and no one was talking about it. And yet, 2 million kids are dying every year because of issues of clean water and sanitation, and I’d never heard anyone talk about it.  And so, as I was intellectually learning about it, I had this experience of going on a water collection with a girl who was 14. She picked up a jerry can, and I picked up a jerry can, and we walked a mile to this well and gathered water together. We talked the whole way, and had this real connection, and she confided in me. I asked her what her hopes were. She was going to move to the big city and be a nurse.  The way she talked about it, I remembered being a 14-year old kid, and Ben and me talking about moving to New York City. It hit me that if someone hadn’t built a well a mile from her house, she never would have had had these dreams, she wouldn’t be in school.  She’d have no prospects for any kind of dignified life. She’d spend all of her time trying to get water for her and her family.  It wasn’t just these ridiculous deaths from things we’ve solved in the West, it was about human dignity. I started thinking about it and how it was what I wanted to focus on.  Around that time my company did a documentary about ultra-marathoners running across the Sahara Desert, so I decided to use that as a way to identify water NGOs on the route that were doing great work, for whom I could raise money. So we started a foundation called H20 Africa.  I kind of intellectually knew that was not the answer, that wells alone were not going to solve this problem, but I figured, what the heck, I can do some good, and something is better than nothing. I can probably reach thousands of people that way. We started to raise a good amount of money.  I started to get more sophisticated with my understanding of the problem, and my thinking, and what my contribution could be. I started looking for the preeminent water expert and someone I could team up with. It led me to Gary White, so I went to him and asked if we could join forces and work together and luckily he agreed. We co-founded Water.org, and what makes it different is how we approach the problem and our perspective about innovation.\n\n"

      "*WOW.*\n\nUm... that's a really good question. First of all, congratulations to you for asking me a Harry Potter question I have NEVER been asked before, that is *not* easily achieved!\n\nI would say... I was gonna say my iPod, prolly put it in that, but I would put it inside an album on the iPod, so you'd have to open that album. So I somehow want it to be connected to a particular album that means something, like Ziggy Stardust. So that's how I'd want to do that. ",
      "*YES*!\n\nJust write that movie! And absolutely! ",
      "Or could there be a film where one of us, is like, an impersonator of the other? We've got to eke out some mileage out of this mistaken identity!",
      "Let's do this!",
      "God... I should probably about the one that was pulled on ME, rather than any I pulled. Because it came from a very unexpected place.\n\nThere's - in the 3rd film - there's a shot in the great hall of all the kids sleeping in the great hall, and the camera starts very very wide, and comes in so that it's an inch from my face, a very long developing set, yeah, and Alan Rickman decided he would plant one of those fart machines in my, uh, sleeping bag, and they waited until like -the camera had come in for this huge DRAMATIC developing shot, and then unleashed this tremendous noise in the great hall.\n\nI immediately thought: \"This is one of the other kids fucking around, and we were going to get in trouble.\"\n\nBut as it turns out, it was one of the members of Britain's acting royalty. \n\nI think I laughed a lot, was probably a bit embarrassed, but it was really really funny. ",
      "HAHA! Brilliant. \n\nJust like... it was exhausting, but New Zealand's lovely all year 'round. ",
      "I've been shown that meme by a few friends, and obviously there are quite a few Harry Potter related memes and jokes and things, you see these things, and I have to say that one really made me laugh! It made me enjoy my name way more than I ever have before. So obviously Daniel Radcliffe beats Daniel Boringcliffe 100% of the time. ",
      "Someone asked me my favourite food: Cheeseburgers. And pizza, and stuff like that. Because I don't believe when people say anything else is their favourite food, I tend not to believe them. ",
      "Well, one of the moments in my life that will forever be... you know, immortal in my memory, would be - because Gary Oldman is a bass player, a very good bass player, yeah, and, um, I started learning bass on the 3rd film when he joined the cast. And so one day, I think actually maybe on my 14th birthday, that day started with Gary teaching me the bass line to \"Come Together\" by the Beatles, yeah! And you know, that was just an amazing, amazing moment. What else... Michael Gambon was always also hilarious to be around. Something not every knows about Michael is that he collects and restores antique dueling pistols. Yeah! And they're really his passion, much more than acting is, and, uh, I remember he one morning gave me a demonstration of how you would shoot a man in a duel with a 17th century pistol in one hand and his morning coffee in the other!\n\nYeah, so my life has been blessed with many surreal, cool moments like that. ",
      "Probably Sirius. Like I always loved the character, and then Gary's portrayal of him I thought was perfect. Or Lupin, really. Any of the characters my dad used to hang out with, other than Wormtail. There was always something bout those two guys I loved a lot. ",
      "I would attribute it to my parents and also to the crew of the Potter films, who were very good at treating us like kids rather than as actors, as they should have done. But yeah, it's hard to say what it comes down to. I think also when you grow up in the media, you get a very clear sense of how crazy the media is, and you know - basically the countdown that Emma's birthday was to when she turned 18, or 17, or whatnot, it was insane. It was insane. And I think when you see that perspective that we all saw at very young ages, you do get an extra level of awareness maybe. But also, thank you for the compliment of saying we are all grounded and intelligent, that is very nice. ",
      "He really does! Um, and, er, he also owned at one point, at one point he owned llamas and a hovercraft, you heard correctly, hahaha, and a 1950's chevy pickup, he had a collection of weird and wonderful things at his house. ",
      "And I suppose I should use this an opportunity to thank whomever made that particular meme, because it really is very good. ",
      "First of all, thank you to that person!\n\nAnd, yeah, you know, in England now when we grow up, there we are, so suffused by American culture, from you know, shows like FRIENDS and FRASIER to the Toy Story movies which I saw when I was obviously very young - I think I've been practicing my American accent - I used to be really into WWF and I would play with wrestling action figures and give them American accents, so I think I've been practicing since I was about 9.\n\nThe only thing I would add to that is that I've been told by quite a few people that i sound like Chris Columbus, who directed the first 2 Harry Potter films, so I think subconsciously I may be doing an impression of him. ",
      "Just \"Dan\" is best. \"Daniel\" is fine, but I always sort of think I'm in trouble. And \"Danny,\" I think, if you call yourself \"Danny\" you give everyone around you the right to sing \"Danny Boy\" to you ALL THE TIME, and it's a nice song, but once you've heard it 1,000 times, you don't want to hear it every time you introduce yourself to somebody. ",
      "I suppose I would... I would remove the bullshit hierarchy from the film industry, because there are certain people who do my job, and also directors and producers, who seem to think the job they do gives them license to treat people who work for them badly, and there is no good reason for that, and it should not be tolerated.\n\nI know that if I ever get to direct, it will not be present anywhere on my set. \n",
      "Um... well, recently a couple of people have asked me to sign a piece of paper so they can then get it tattooed. And, you know, that's pretty weird. Just because I have pretty horrible handwriting - that AMA sign was me printing, but you should see my cursive, it's not pretty! So yeah, I would advise people against doing that. I have signed a picture of Elijah Wood - and I think we've also both said in interviews that we would like each other to play each other in films of our lives - but I was on a red carpet in Japan, and this Japanese man gave me a picture of Elijah, and I knew i wasn't going to get past the language barrier to explain, so I wrote \"I am not Elijah Wood, signed Daniel Radcliffe.\"\n\nAnd then also people seem obsessed with getting me to sign baseballs, which I don't understand... Quidditch balls would be relevant, at least, but just baseballs, for no reason at all. ",
      "George Clooney... Jennifer Lawrence... I just think they'd be really cool, Paul Rudd, I met him and was like \"You're awesome!\" I just want to work with people you can get on with, and you have a good rapport with, and those are definitely some of them. Also directors more than actors, whom I think \"I want to work with them.\" So you know, people like the Coen Brothers, or Wes Anderson, Paul Thomas Anderson, Christopher Nolan, again, it's directors i suppose I get more excited about than actors. ",
      "That's a *GOOD* question. I don't know yet, I haven't narrowed it down, but because I've very recently - like within the last 6 months - watched the original Star Wars movies, I'm like a brand new Star Wars fan, so I might go with something Star Wars related! And I got to go out to the Star Wars set recently, because a lot of my friends are working on it crew-wise.. so something Star Wars related, but not sure yet.\n\nAny suggestions? \n\nI'm leaning towards Boba Fett, but I haven't found a good enough costume yet. ",
      "You know what, I don't think we did I'm pretty sure. Because I think that by that point, they had figured out my handwriting was so bad that they would never let it be seen in the film. So I'm pretty sure one of the props guys wrote \"Harry Potter\" neatly on a piece of paper for me to put in. ",
      "HAHAHA!\n\nUm, yeah! I mean, pretty terrifying! The first few years I was genuinely quite intimidated by Alan, just because of the voice and the way he sort of carries himself. But as I grew up, I realized he was one of the kindest and most supportive members of that cast to me. I mean, Alan has cut short holidays that he's been having to come and see me in plays, and take me out for dinner afterwards to talk to me about stuff, I think when he realized how serious I was about wanting to be an actor, and he knew what a particular world the Potter set was to grow up in, he just sort of made it his - he just really wanted to help us all and has been very helpful to me, certainly. ",
      "Um.... Well, growing up, my favourite comic book character was Daredevil, so Daredevil was great, but there was also, like, if I could be one character from all of literature it would be... Woland from my favourite book, wait no, I change my answer, I would be Behemoth the cat from my favourite book which is called The Master and Margarita, and he is like, a 5 foot tall black cat who shoots a revolver. ",
      "Ehm - not particularly.\n\nI think we had very quickly become aware that stuff was not going to be in all the films that we couldn't fit everything in, I think I remember the thing early on that me, Emma and Rupert were all slightly surprised by, that we had all ABSOLUTELY LOVED the chapter in the Chamber of Secrets book about the - I think was it Nearly Headless Nick's Birthday Party? But I think it was some sort of a ghost birthday party that was not in the films, and I remember at the time we were all quite surprised by that. I know some people would have been quite happy to see a 4 hour long Harry Potter movie with every detail in there, but some people also would not have... ",
      "I mean, I... to me, it's not a... to me I absolutely think I would be in Gryffindor! But there's never any doubt of that for me. Yeah. I like, maybe I'm just biased because I played one for so long, but I could never picture myself in any other colours. ",
      "Oh! I mean... anywhere you'd care to name. I've been recognized in Antigua, I got recognized a lot there. \n\nThere isn't anywhere in the world Potter hasn't reached.\n\nI was on a roller coaster, I think it was in Paris, actually, and it was in the middle of winter, and I was wearing basically like a thing in England, don't know if you have them here, we called them \"Snoods\" - they're like a warm thing that covers you whole head, basically only shows your eyes, and I was like 12 years old, I was wearing one on a roller coaster, and I guess my eyes do give me away because the people BEHIND us somehow recognized me and asked an autograph when we got off the coaster !And we were like \"How did you SEE me?!\" it was impressive. ",
      "well, which Hedwig? There were 3 or 4. I imagine they are all still living with Gary Gero, who was the head of the animals department on Potter. I imagine he is looking after them all somewhere. I imagine they are all at the home where actor owls retire to. ",
      "The villain. 100%. I think it's generally more interesting, and honestly, more what I'm suited for, to be honest. I don't see myself necessarily - I mean, I know there was a lot of action in Potter and I liked those sequences, but I don't think of myself as a natural action star. ",
      "Not really.\n\nEven as a kid, I hadn't the full scope of the Harry Potter phenomenon, hadn't really, ever, made an impression on me I guess? Obviously I'd read the first couple of books, but I wasn't as into it as a lot of my class was, so no, I could never have imagined it was as big as it was. I think maybe it's only now that I'm really starting to get a fuller sense of how wide-reaching it was, and how many people's lives it affected, which is very cool. ",
      "Can they be dead?\n\nOkay.\n\nWell, uh, I would say, um: this is hard. Probably John Lennon, cuz that'd be awesome, and, uh, Tom Lehrer, who's a comic songwriter whom I'm obsessed with, yeah, and what's an all-time dinner fantasy party without Einstein? So Einstein, *yeah*! and probably Keith Richards, yeah, to liven everything up.  ",
      "Hmmm.\n\nI suppose I'm trying to... I'm trying to care less what people think of me, and the way I have done that, very successfully the past few months now, is *not* look at stuff on the internet. That is the key. ",
      "Oh yeah, of course. I wasn't going to leave there without grabbing a set of glasses!",
      "Em - the Potter Puppet Pals were always, I thought, very very funny. It is hard to make really good Harry Potter jokes, though, because a lot of them have been done, but I thought Puppet Pals were very funny. The best \"Alan Rickman as Snape\" impression was, 100%, Bill Hader when I did Saturday Night Live, yeah, but maybe my favourite joke at Harry Potter's expense was in South Park, the episode, The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring. It's not a very PC joke, but it really made me laugh. ",
      "Ok, that's a good question. I would go with WOLF for the land animal, definitely, because I've always loved wolves. I think... for the air animal, it would have to be maybe like an albatross, one of those long distance journey birds, that would cool. And then for a *sea animal*... I guess I'd want to be a shark, because not much could fuck with you! Because the sea strikes me as a horrible place, anything could kill you all the time, so the sea is where you would want to be a shark. Like a great white or a Hammerhead, maybe Hammerheads because they are more social. \n\nSo maybe a hammerhead shark, to be specific. Because i like the power of being a shark, but i don't like the isolation of a great white's life. ",
      "Well, I watch a lot of sports videos and stuff like that. I think the NFL Bad Lip Reading might be one of my favourite YouTube things. I watch a lot of Ted Talks, in terms of things on the internet. \n\nWhat else do i watch? That's the thing... I like all sorts of, it's great for research, YouTube, and watching Alan Ginsberg debate William Buckley, things like that. I lost a lot of time like that, because since then I've watched all of Buckley's interviews like that with Gore Vidal and Noam Chomsky... Because it's kind of intellectual heavyweight debate that is gone from television now, but is still cool to watch. And because I met him quite recently, in the last few days I've been watching a lot of Russell Brand's videos on there. I met him because he was promoting his new book in the UK. Normally I immediately distrust actors as soon as they are talking about politics, because i think it's quite self-serving, but he's *very* sincere, and I really got on with him when I met him. ",
      "I do. Yes, I definitely do. ",
      "Well, that's incredibly kind, and, you know, you're welcome, I have, I think, just as much fun making those films as you did watching them, so it's always lovely when people say it as if I've done them a favour and I was having the best time of my life making those films, so it was a win-win for everybody I think. \n\nIn terms of - I just finished reading SLAUGHTERHOUSE 5, which is a fantastic book, and I would hopefully be in any adaptation of Master and Margarita, I would do literally absolutely anything on that set if they would let me, but in terms of like other books I would recommend, I also read a book not long ago called \"Foe\" and it's kind of a reimagining of the Robinson Crusoe story,  I'll leave it at that but it's a brilliant book. ",
      "Wonderful. I mean, he was just such a sweet man. You know... kind of relentlessly charming with women, I think I'm pretty sure I saw him flirting with female journalists at press conferences, I remember being a young child in awe of it... but yeah, he was a legend, and so to have been able to work with somebody of that generation, which was an incredibly important generation of actors for Britain, is amazing. ",
      "Um, we listened to heavy metal, basically. That was it. Yeah! And because the two guys that were doing the makeup, Mike McCarthy and Mike Fields, they were both big metal heads, and I mean, the actual process -they made it *so* easy - the horns themselves only took about 20 minutes to put on, and even some of the more extreme makeup that we had near the end only took a couple of hours, so you know, I had it easier than a lot of actors do. And yeah, so Metallica, Megadeth, and what was the other band we listened to loads of... *shit*... can't remember it'll come back to me. ",
      "Yeah... favourite scene to film... god... that is a *really hard* question, to pick just one... the first thing that comes to mind, and it's a silly one, but doing all the Gringott's stuff in the last movie with Rupert and Helena and Warwick and Emma, that was like a really fun time. We were all enjoying ourselves in that, it's an action sequence so it was quite, it was more of a technical challenge than an emotional one, so it was a lot of fun to get right. ",
      "Um, I don't really drink much tea! If I do, it's with a little bit of milk and no sugar. But in terms of breakfast... I mean, um, my ideal breakfast would probably be eggs benedict with a large bowl of cereal brand - it's stuff called CrunchyNut, yeah, which you *can* get in America, but you really have to search for it, but it's an English cereal, and it's the best. With milk, oh yeah. No fruit, don't be silly. Just basically eggs, bacon, bread and cereal in any form is my ideal breakfast. ",
      "Dog. Very, very firmly in the dog camp here. ",
      "I haven't been approached! And I don't know - haha- I don't know what I would do. My lack of Game of Thrones knowledge was revealed in an interview a while ago. I totally would side with the Starks, though, because their symbol is a wolf. ",
      "Um, the Colbert Report. Mystery Science Theater 3000. Yeah, like I JUST discovered them, and I am *obsessed* at the moment! They're amazing yeah! And there's also an English show, called The Thick of It, which is kind of a show - Armando Ianucci who does VEEP, it was the political show that spring boarded him to start working here, and it's some of the best, funniest television that's ever been made. ",
      "That's wonderful, and I love you too, but we should probably see other people. ",
      "No, I haven't. There was one yesterday, actually, and I'm here. You know, I love the NFL, and I'm actually from London, so I feel like I am *the* exact target audience for the proposed London NFL team, and yet even I think it's a ridiculous idea, like the idea that American players would be forced to play for a London team which they wouldn't have the same amount of, you know, pride in playing for is a very odd thing. I want to see LOADS of NFL, I love they do games at Wembley, but a London team is, I think, a bit odd to me. ",
      "No, it wasn't something we thought about at the time. I have thought about it much more lately than I probably ever did at the time... but yeah, it feels wonderful, honestly, to have people still come up to you and say you were such a huge part of my childhood. It's genuinely lovely. I am very lucky to be famous for something so many people loved. And there's... yeah, I always like to say that I think some people think that because I'm making an effort to have a career for myself after Potter, that they somehow think I want to *escape* Potter? And I don't, I\"m very proud of what those films were, and what we did with them. And so I always like to say I am happy to hear from people who still love the movies. \n\nI remember when I met, once, a guy who'd been in a punk band in the 70's, and then he wouldn't talk about this punk days at all to me when I was asking, he sort of didn't want anything to do with it? And I remember being really disappointed by that, and thinking of how uncool it was for him to disown the thing that made him, and I just would never do that. ",
      "Um... I suppose the worst thing is that because I was a child actor, you get a lot of questions about like, you know, you get a lot of, for a while is that child actors were perceived as bratty and obnoxious, so you come up against that quite a bit. And the best thing, is, obviously, being mistaken for Elijah Wood. ",
      "I mean, that is actually very difficult.\n\nI would probably try and fight the huge duck. Because I think that I could sort of... try, if I could break it, then I could have the giant duck as my steed! So I think i'd go for that, because 100 tiny Elijahs, they are going to be very hard to control, I feel like that would be the last scene out of Toy Soldiers or something like that. ",
      "I think it stays very true to the book. Of course some things have to change, but to me, what makes the book remarkable is the mixing of the romantic elements, the comic elements, and the, sort of, horror and fantasy stuff, and what we have absolutely done in the film is captured all those tones and they compliment each other beautifully as they do in the book. So that would be the biggest success of the movie's adaptation. ",
      "VERY important. To be honest, if Alex Aja and Joe Hill are happy with my performance, then I'm happy with it! Those are the two people I'm thinking about most, and talking to most, about my thoughts on the character and my approach to it. ",
      "Don't worry! I've caught up since, it's fine. ",
      "Only, uh, for myself. I think Shakespeare is a wonderful thing to work on for me when I want to prepare for a part but I don't want to over-work on the script. So I will find a character in Shakespeare that i feel explores the same themes as whatever i'm playing, and sort of work on it like that, because the way Shakespeare writes, he writes so viscerally about so many universal things, that it's an amazing resource for actors preparing.\n\nBut I would LOVE to do some for real. ",
      "So yeah, the fact that they are happy is awesome!",
      "Nothing, actually. I didn't! I just got up and started doing interviews. ",
      "Cool! Thank you very much! Well, I did a romantic comedy that came out this summer called \"What if\" that is pretty funny, and I hope I get to do a lot of comedy for the rest of my career. It's what i grew up watching, mostly, so I am definitely drawn to it, and I like to think I bring a bit of it to anything I do - even a dramatic film like \"Kill Your Darlings\" can have some very light moments to it as well. ",
      "When you do a show on Broadway, the overwhelming sense of how excited everyone is to *be* there, from the audience to the people you are working with in the show, is *amazing* and creates one of the most exciting working environments I've ever been in. And, you know, the bond that is formed by doing a show together for a year is really something quite remarkable. And you know, I have probably more friends in terms of the people I see regularly from HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS even from something like Potter, to be honest, because there are relationships you form - that's the way I've always found it generally, with film the strongest bonds i form are with the crew, and with theater I form the strongest bonds with the cast, because when you are onstage and have to look out for each other's backs in that way, it forms a very very strong connection. ",
      "Despite being English, I am not, I'm afraid. It just passed me by. It was never one of the things I was into as a kid. So I'm sorry, Who fans. ",
      "Um... I would say: Oooh! I would say a few different types of cheese, maybe like, a gruyere in there, with some cheddar as well, you have to have some meat, if it's not bacon it should be Parma ham or something like that, maybe a few different types of ham, in fact, and then ideally some sort of brioche-bun thing... some sort of brioche-y type bread would be ideal.

      "Well, because of the nature of the Horns mean that people confess their deepest, darkest stuff to him, and do crazy things around him all the time, it sort of means that the challenge as an actor is doing justice to the insanity of the situation that you're in, and reacting appropriately to the craziness, but also keeping it grounded and real and truthful, because you can't just have, you know, 2 hours of people freaking out, that's not interesting to watch.\n\nSo yeah, the challenge was finding the balance between the craziness of the story, and the *very real* tone that we wanted to get for the film.

So thank you for the recommendation! ",
      "Yes, of course, absolutely, God! I think that was part of the huge success of those books, is that it taps into a set of powers and a fantasy world that literally *everybody* would love to be a part of.

      "Um, I am much more of like a sports gamer. So I love the Madden games, all the NFL stuff, boxing games, Fifa a bit, but I also love Call of Duty. I can get lost on that for a few hours. But yeah, I'm not very good at video games. I tend to play them to the point where - I think the reason I like sports games is because there are no levels to get through, because i always reach a point on other games where I can't get any further, and it's not fun anymore, so that's when I ditch them and go back to playing Madden.

      "Oh.\n\nI think, again, and I'm sorry, it's like the third time I've referenced it in this AMA, but I would go with The Master and Margarita, because it has never been done as well as it could be, so I am hoping I will meet that eccentric billionaire at some point. ",

      "Great question.\n\nLength - 5 inches, max. On its best day. I did some research back in the day, that would put me in the 10th percentile in America - but I believe 5.25 inches is the 50th percentile. So, when you say 10th percentile, it looks terrible, but when you think about how it's only a quarter of an inch away from the industry standard, it's easier to swallow.\n\nGirth - I have rock solid girth. Great girth even. That's the key to me surviving out here. I don't know the exact dimensions, but back when I was researching this stuff, I tied a string around my boner and measured the circumference and learned that I was 90th percentile in terms of girth.\n\nSo 10th length, 90th girth, that puts me somewhere in the middle of America. I used to be really self conscious about it growing up, but in my young adult years, I've found it to be completely capable of creating the female orgasm. It's just a bit limiting positionally. ",

When I began putting out videos, I honestly barely even knew what reddit was, I was completely unfamiliar with the site, let alone the complex intricacies of “gaming a system”. The realities are, if I saw a video of mine posted on Reddit, the MOST I have ever done is shoot a text to my high school friends (say 5-10 guys) saying “yo dudes, my latest video is on reddit, if you get a chance, upvote it.” I highly doubt this is the type of “gaming” you guys are referencing when discussing my ban. I assume you assume something bigger is going on, because this seems fairly harmless to me. These are 5-10 people of tens of thousands that are deciding on content. My content just does really well on the platform, that’s really the bare bones of it. There’s no cheating going on. I’m honestly getting fairly tired of answering the question, to be real.\n\nEDIT: One thing I’ll add - and this goes to show my complete lack of familiarity with the platform at the time, was I posted the initial ex boyfriend reddit link to my personal facebook account, saying “look guys, it’s climbing reddit, go upvote” or something, not at all thinking it was a remotely frowned upon action. It seemed like a completely logical thing to do at the time. Now, I hear that type of thing is frowned upon, so I haven’t done it since - and once again, I seriously doubt that was the “gaming” that would get someone banned from a subreddit.",

      "Edit:\nI've been told I should post proof and this is how it's done.\nhttp://imgur.com/ORcGMM8\n\nHey guys, this is Lil Dicky (please, call me Dave).  A while ago, it was brought to my attention that I was being accused of creating fake accounts for upvotes, or gaming the system so to speak.  Today, I was told the same issue keeps being brought up so I wanted to respond directly to all of this, because it’s entirely untrue.   I don’t really understand where these accusations are coming from, but allow me to explain my history with Reddit, and perhaps it will clear things up. \n\nIronically, I’ve been pretty unfamiliar with reddit for my entire life, up until my music videos began being posted. I had obviously heard about it, but didn’t really know what it was, or actively reddit or anything.  Back in the day, when my first video (ex-boyfriend) was posted and doing well on reddit, I posted on my personal facebook account, informing my friends of such, and saying “go upvote it if you get the chance!” or something of that nature.  I did it without any knowledge that something like that was “against the rules” or frowned upon on reddit. Remember, this is a guy who doesn’t know a thing about the site or how it works at that point in time. In my mind, it made sense to have a few friends support the cause, the way they do when they share my videos on their facebooks and stuff.  I assume about 10 friends of mine ended up making an account, and upvoted the first few videos that came out within a month of my existence on the internet. As soon as I got wind that this was actually frowned upon, I immediately told them to stop.  So, at the height of this alleged scandal, it wasn’t more than 10-15 friends of mine casually upvoting my first month’s worth of content when something got posted on reddit. Nothing beyond that.  I imagine out of the tens of thousands of upvotes that those videos received, my friends’ impact was rather negligible. I think my videos are just designed to do well on user-driven platforms like reddit.  Around that time, I was also contacted by a mod who wanted to hear my side of things given it was repeatedly being suggested that I was using fake accounts.  I told him all the same things I am telling you guys here, figured he would try to get to the bottom of it, and hopefully clear my good name.  After not hearing any more on the subject, I figured that was that.  \n\nSince those first few videos (so, within the past 15 months), there hasn’t been anything that could even be misconstrued as inappropriate as far as I can tell.  Take today for example. I’ve got no clue who posted it. I don’t know who any of these people that are making comments are. I am just a dude sitting in his room right now, writing raps and contemplating masturbation.  My videos get posted, and people upvote them and comment on them. I don’t know who these people are, but I certainly am thankful for their support. I am however, getting a little bit bothered by these allegations that I’m a scam or a cheat, because people talk about it so matter-of-factly, yet I’m sitting here just thinking “what on earth are these people even talking about?”   I take pride in the fact that there's no machine behind me. It's just me. So it kind of rubs me the wrong way to be accused of being the opposite of that.\n\nIn conclusion, if it’s really that wrong to inform a few of your friends from home that your video is on reddit and available to be upvoted, I hope you forgive my past ignorance to such a thing.   It seemed like a normal way for one to behave. However, in learning that it apparently is not, I put a stop to it over a year ago. And anything you are seeing now, like with this new video, is just reddit being reddit - and upvoting what they like.  I have no control over any voting or comments posted here, but if I still haven't convinced you guys then please downvote the video and move on.  I just want to put a stop to idea that I am somehow scamming anyone, or that any of the response reddit has had to my videos isn't genuine.  \n\nI will be on the move the rest of today, but I am doing my first AMA tomorrow.  Feel free to ask me any more questions you might have about this tomorrow.  Thanks, Dave.  \n",

      "So forgive me if i’m misinterpreting, but you’re saying I’m not behind the manipulation…rather, it is most likely fans (because my facebook friends were certainly not active participants in the immediate upvote of anything, as I mentioned) - so it’s fans that are actively encouraging upvotes…because they are fans and want to see me succeed…because of that, I am banned from being a part of the hip hop subreddit? Doesn’t that seem unfair to you?\n\nWhat facebook groups are you referring to anyways? Even though I’ve got nothing to do with it, I’m curious what evidence you have about these groups that are responsible for my entire career.\n\nI know I’m not Kanye or Drake, but maybe it’s because these people feel closer to me, and perhaps more responsible for the launch of my career (since it all began on reddit) which makes them even more impassioned to upvote with fervor. \n\nAt the end of the day, what I’m seeing here is that I’m being punished for having super passionate fans. Like I’ve said, I really don’t have anything to do with the success of my videos.\n\nIn all honesty, it sounds like you are making yourself bigger than the subreddit itself. The subreddit is about hip hop. I am an up-and-coming rapper, that people in the reddit community seem to enjoy. Don’t you think the purpose of the subreddit is to give people everything they want to see and hear about the latest news in hip hop? By banning me, you are removing a part of that conversation, whether or not you like my music or not. It was #1 on billboard last week, it’s relevant to the discussion.\n\nI only ever spoke to one mod, user Naly_D, and all i did was tell my side of things, in email form. Go and check the email, it was basically this exact conversation.  He seemed to believe what I had to say, and nothing else ever came from it.  You literally just said i’m not the one gaming the system, so why am i being punished for it? And why am i still receiving messages consistently that say I cheated the system? Why is this still the prevailing opinion in your subreddit if you just admitted I'm not organizing anything?  I admitted that when the first video released I posted on my personal facebook saying that it was on the front page and to go check it out.  I was completely unfamiliar with the practices of reddit and had no idea this could ever possibly be considered an issue.  Once I was told that this was a problem, i told people to stop.  This all happened after my 2nd or 3rd video released, and as far as i'm told, happened in the videos section of reddit, not even your own sub.  You say my friends gamed the system, but that was maybe 10 people, within the first month of my existence on youtube.  You say my fans gamed the system, but isn’t the entire point of the system that users submit content and vote it up or down based on whether they like it? So if I have a lot of fans on this website, wouldn’t it make complete fucking sense that my content would consistently do well?  How is this gaming the system? It IS the system. ",

It's kind of the antithesis of the traditional rap mindset of hyper-masculinity, acting like you are cooler than everyone, etc. Like, I've literally heard rappers brag about how big their dicks are. I find that state of thinking to be a bit archaic. So I wanted my name to reflect the parodying of such behavior.\n\nTruthfully, I can't wait for the day where every rapper/fan has to be like yeahhhh, Lil Dicky is dope.

      "Someone told me the same issue has come up here, so I will copy and paste what I said elsewhere. \n\nI was also told you need to prove your identity, this is me doing that.\nhttp://imgur.com/ORcGMM8\n\n\"Hey guys, this is Lil Dicky (please, call me Dave). A while ago, it was brought to my attention that I was being accused of creating fake accounts for upvotes, or gaming the system so to speak. Today, I was told the same issue keeps being brought up so I wanted to respond directly to all of this, because it’s entirely untrue. I don’t really understand where these accusations are coming from, but allow me to explain my history with Reddit, and perhaps it will clear things up.\nIronically, I’ve been pretty unfamiliar with reddit for my entire life, up until my music videos began being posted. I had obviously heard about it, but didn’t really know what it was, or actively reddit or anything. Back in the day, when my first video (ex-boyfriend) was posted and doing well on reddit, I posted on my personal facebook account, informing my friends of such, and saying “go upvote it if you get the chance!” or something of that nature. I did it without any knowledge that something like that was “against the rules” or frowned upon on reddit. Remember, this is a guy who doesn’t know a thing about the site or how it works at that point in time. In my mind, it made sense to have a few friends support the cause, the way they do when they share my videos on their facebooks and stuff. I assume about 10 friends of mine ended up making an account, and upvoted the first few videos that came out within a month of my existence on the internet. As soon as I got wind that this was actually frowned upon, I immediately told them to stop. So, at the height of this alleged scandal, it wasn’t more than 10-15 friends of mine casually upvoting my first month’s worth of content when something got posted on reddit. Nothing beyond that. I imagine out of the tens of thousands of upvotes that those videos received, my friends’ impact was rather negligible. I think my videos are just designed to do well on user-driven platforms like reddit. Around that time, I was also contacted by a mod who wanted to hear my side of things given it was repeatedly being suggested that I was using fake accounts. I told him all the same things I am telling you guys here, figured he would try to get to the bottom of it, and hopefully clear my good name. After not hearing any more on the subject, I figured that was that.\nSince those first few videos (so, within the past 15 months), there hasn’t been anything that could even be misconstrued as inappropriate as far as I can tell.

      "1) I mean, it certainly depends on the humidity, along with several other factors. Like right now, there's no slope. It's just like...imagine a thumb resting atop two...I don't even know if it's two. Right now, my testicles feel like one thing. Honestly, my penis right now is a soft penis... I'll just show you. It looks like an inch. There's no slope. It's just there. So like I said, it depends. Right now, it's essentially like an extended clit.\n\n2) It was great working with Snoop. He understood what I was trying to do immediately. It didn't take him long. He was into it. \n\nI'm just like you guys in terms of how I perceive Snoop Dogg. I'm very much like what an icon that guy is, you know what I mean? Meeting him, he couldn't be more of a dream in terms of what you'd expect him or hope that he'd be. He's like the ideal version that you'd hope for in your dreams. That's who he actually is. So it was very wonderful to meet a guy like that who you have such high hopes for and he actually exceeds them.\n\nIn the future, there's a lot of rappers I want to work with. Right now (and it's not just because I said \"in the future\"), my number one rapper to work with is Future. \n\nOh look. Snoop Dogg just tweeted at me. Which is cool. But like, I do have a song with him, so I shouldn't be that excited about a tweet. But it is the first public acknowledgement of that song, so it does feel good. I'm going to retweet it.",

It's given me my voice. It's truly where I found out who I was. It's everything to me.\n\nJust because I'm taking one art form that I love (comedy) and applying it within another art form that I love (rap), it doesn't mean I'm devaluing the importance of the genre. I don't think anything is \"above\" being influenced by comedy. Who doesn't enjoy laughing? Can you imagine if comedy wasn't ever accepted as a part of film? We'd have no comedy movies.\n\nI understand people being confused, but I think you respect hip hop by a) going hard every song and rapping your ass off. and b) by being your complete, original self. Realness is one of the most important factors to hip hop, to me. \n\nAnd I think I do both of those things. Which is why yes, even though a lot of my songs are funny, I think I deserve to be taken seriously in the rap world, regardless of race, class, gender, anything. If you go hard and are true to yourself, and people enjoy listening to your music, it's real. ",

My favorite move at Richmond was to go to the pier and you know how they had chicken finger sandwiches and they had buffalo chicken wraps, but they didn't offer buffalo chicken sandwiches? \n\nI was the first guy to suggest why not put the buffalo chicken that you put in a wrap on a bun? And I'd get that all the time and because it wasn't a menu item, they didn't actually have that prepared. So every time I requested it, they had to make it fresh—and I got a fresh buffalo chicken sandwich every time from D-Hall. And, you know, certain cashiers weren't overly enthused by this, but other ones respected the hustle.\n\nI was a huge WaWa fan until they stopped serving grilled chicken—now the only chicken I can get is breaded form and I don't think WaWa is especially strong at the breaded chicken. So, you know, I love WaWa simply because it's a northeast staple, but if I'm being honest about the type of food that I'm enjoying, WaWa doesn't really satisfy me at this point. ",

Dave can't really just do whatever he pleases, because he lives in this society. Lil Dicky can though. So it's kind of my most unfiltered version of myself. I never have Dicky do shit I don't in turn agree with or stand for. And I think there are times I'm writing it as Dave too, I don't know that it's even a character at this point.

      "So my experience in Melbourne was like really unique, in the sense that it wasn't at all what I expected to be. I expected to get off the plane, throw on a pair of board shorts, get picked up by some blonde dude with long hair and like, just really be outside in the sun for 5 months with *girls*. But Melbourne was kind of chilly and what I learned quickly is that Australian girls have *no* interest in American guys–I mean that's what I gathered or whatever I was doing was not working. I think American guys flirt kind of in a forward way.\n\nI remember specifically being in club, and like touching a girl's shoulder being like - \"Hi, how's your night going?\" and she just flinched just like \"Don't touch me!\". And the American girls couldn't be less interested in the American guy when there like tons of Australian hunks walking around. So I've never gotten less female attention in my life than the 5 months that I spent in Melbourne. BUT, I was with these five other dudes who were going through the exact same thing and it was like a weird male bonding 5 month period where a bunch of guys just hung out and got drunk together like 3 nights a week. I don't know why that's that interesting–but it was probably like 3 or 4 nights a week. And we didn't do anything but be stupid with one another. There were things like me being put in a shopping cart and thrown down a hill–that's the kind of stuff I did in Australia. I need to go back and experience it as somebody that's capable of hooking up with a girl.\n\nAnd marketing - what I learned in school didn't at all help me in terms of this, but I think what I got in school in terms of a degree got me a job at my advertising agency and working at the ad agency how possible it was to create content very easily and cheaply. We had an in-house production wing at my agency, so every day I was seeing these short little videos that they'd churn out that looked amazing that they did in 6 hours, for no money, and I thought 'Huh... I wonder if you could apply this technology to your crazy ideas.'\n\nOther than that, I don't put much stock in the school/work life contribution to my rap career.",

I've only been online for like 20 months. So to be where I'm at now is insane, and I'm certainly appreciative of that and don't lose sight. And I also recognize that once I \"arrive\" that's forever. You can't \"un-arrive.\" I'll be dealing with the consequences of legitimate celebrity, both good and bad, forever.\n\nSo in a weird way, I try to fight my impatient urges to finally make it on the mainstream level, because I know my first life is reaching its end, and my second life is about to begin.

In my case, I knew there was such a small percentage of people out there capable of doing what I can do, and I knew an even SMALLER percentage within that small percentage would ever act on it. And it was knowing that that got me that much more inspired to act, because of all of the people that may be capable of something, more than half of them aren't ever going to actually do it, which means it's less competition.\n\nTo do something you love doing, it's gotta be the perfect storm of talent, and relentless drive. I would just caution you to be really smart about what you go for.",

So I became involved in a street hockey game that took place every weekend for over 10 years, every weekend, red versus black.

Their heart and soul and thought that goes into their work has a compassion for the human condition, and seeks to create a better world and to help us be on the path of doing that.  They also both have a wonderful sense of humor.  They are very funny.  They are not really jokesters, but I remember one time in the scene where Neo and Trinity are going into the lobby, trying to save Morpheus, and I was looking at the set and turned to Lana and Andy and said \"so what does this mean?\" you know, enjoying how the lobby looked and its architecture and the intention of the set we were about to destroy through gunplay. And Lana went on a 2 minute riff about structure, form, architecture, the idea of power and control being manifested through this room, and continued on about how this was part of the breaking down of these structures and Andy said \"yeah there's a lot of straight lines.\"  And that to me was funny. \n\nWhy thank you very much.

Kathryn Bigelow the director really wanted to push the boundaries of what actors could do and with the camera, trying to put the audience and inspire the audience of viewers with the environments, so the surfing, the skydiving, in a way that even the excitement of a bank robbery.  And I think all of the actors and the crew felt that, the fight scenes, so there was a real energy from her that I think came through the picture.  And working with the wonderful Patrick Swayze, he really spearheaded that as well in that he was jumping out of airplanes while he was filming, the other actors were jumping out of airplanes, I was getting to go surfing, everyone was getting into it.  No one robbed any banks.  The party scene had some partying going on.  And I remember actually I was in LA and Kathryn was casting for the female lead and I remember I saw this woman come in driving this old beat up Cadillac and I was to meet actresses that day, and I saw this woman and I said \"that's the actress,\" and it turned out to be Lori Petty, and I was right.

And then with SPEED, I was given the opportunity to try, I worked with a wonderful stunt coordinator called Gary Hines who put me under the bus, and let me dangle down elevator shafts, and I think that those two films really helped prepare me for what I was getting into in terms of the Matrix.  Definitely when I was going into the Matrix and meeting the Wachowskis, I knew that we were going in to do something that was special.  There was four months of training before filming.  And the ambition of the project was really exciting to be a part of, and then to actually be on the set and realizing the vision of the directors was one of the special moments of my life.\n\nThat sounds GOOD!

So in order to make it viable to be able to be seen in China, I thought of making the film as a PG13 film.  I didn't really feel like it was necessary during the fights.  I withheld the blood to other moments, like when people were getting stabbed, like when the villain kills someone.  \n\nIn real life, I don't know any martial arts.  In movie kung fu, I am a fairly \"high hand.\"\n\nYou know, let's see, you can't go wrong with some oatmeal and honey.  Growing up, when I was a kid, it was like frosted flakes, but the milk has to be cold, the milk with cereal has to be cold.  And you can't have too much milk, because you don't want the frosted flakes to get too soggy.  You have to eat them before they get too mushy. Also a pain chocolate with a cappucinno.  And then you can just go with some toast, with some apricot jam, cappucinno, that sounds pretty good.  There's also pancakes with bacon and sliced banana on the side, with maple syrup.  ",

I grew up a little bit here when I was a kid, and the city has inspired me, you know, in my early studies, Broadway and off broadway and theater, and getting older and living in New York, the energy of the city, I've just had so many great moments and times here.

      "When I work on a film, you know, I try to get or inhabit the body of the character -from the vision of the directors or how i think the character should be - so if it's a film like SPEED, you hit the gym, you get to do some, train with SWAT People, hehe, but in general, I'm really focused and dedicated, and then in regular life, I don't go to the gym as often.\n\nAnd I have a wonderful trainer, someone that I've worked with for over 20 years, who - we've just become friends and they are an inspiration into getting the shape of the character. ",
      "Oh yeah!\n\nSPAM... and breakfast! Fried spam with some rice, yeah! Like in a  skillet! Spam from a skillet into the white rice - Ono! But I haven't had that dish for a long time, since I was a kid. Oh, are you kidding me? That was *Fantastic.* That was a good meal. ",
      "I don't cook.\n\nI wish I did.\n\nBut I don't. ",
      "Yeah, there's a lot of great writing, and characters, and stories being told in television nowadays. And much more than there used to be. The opportunities to tell stories, because of the opportunities to show content. And so it's drawing actors from cinema, movie actors, actors to where there's a lot of opportunities to where you can tell stories. Specifically for John Rain, I first went to it thinking that it would be - it's a wonderful series, it's 8 books, I was thinking that maybe this would be a character in one of the books to make a film, but after getting familiar, it felt like it didn't want to be a movie, it wanted to be serialized, learning more about who he was through serialization. It's perfect for that. And that's in the works. ",
      "Thank you.\n\nYou know, the memory that i have of Patrick, um, at this moment, is - I remember meeting him when we were starting on POINT BREAK, and he kind of walked up and he had a big smile on his face, and he kind reached out and shook my hand, and he was just like, \"Hey man, nice to meetcha! This movie's crazy great! and LET'S DO IT!\"\n\nAnd so... he really was, in a way, the captain of the film in the sense of how he just inspired and motivated everyone during the film. His passion and his enthusiasm, I mean, he started jumping out of airplanes while we were filming, and then he got some of the other guys who were in the gang jumping out of airplanes. I mean, he was just... this bright light.\n\nWorking with Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman was a great honor, very exciting, and yes, pretty scary the first time we did scenes together.\n\nThey were both very gracious, and I remember when I was doing - we went up to the director's house, for a week of rehearsals, and I just- to me Gary Oldman at the time (and continues to be ) one of the greatest actors, and so for me I was just kind of watching him and trying to learn. And Anthony Hopkins was, he was very - his HUMOR, I was surprised by his humor and his quiet wisdom. He just had this wisdom and humor. It was great to be around. ",
      "Thank you very much!  Yeah, The Devil's Advocate is one of my favorites as well.  The Motorcycle Company is called Arch Motorcycles, and I went into partnership with a Los Angeles builder named Gard Hollinger.  And we have built a prototype which you can see on the company website, and we are very close to finishing the production model.  ",
      "It's been a lovely day.  I like Sundays.  Sunday is the day of rest.  I am currently working on a film and we were shooting nights, so I got to sleep in a little bit.  It's been a quiet morning.  I am looking forward to going to work tomorrow.  So it was nice just to rest a little bit, and then to start to look at the script, and get ready for work on Monday.  ",
      "*Hehehehe!*\n\nUm, hello! And Hi! Yeah, I would love to work with the Wachowskis again. They're such visionaries, and their films, their stories, have offered us so much in terms of who we are and how we think and matters of the heart and spirit. So yes! I hope they call me!",
      "*HMmmm.*\n\nToday I am going to pick: Heroes. ",
      "I first met Dennis Hopper on River's Edge, and Blue Velvet had not come out yet, but he was really open and congenial and you know, it was cool to sit and have lunch with the guy.  But he was talking about his work, Frederic Elmes was shooting the River's Edge and he had shot Blue Velvet and Dennis Hopper was sharing the story of the guy he had just finished playing, just off the hook in this film, and I had been really affected by Eraserhead by David Lynch, and he was just really an open, cool, hanging out guy.   To me, he is someone I grew up watching and was inspired by in Apocalypse Now and Easy Rider, and then when I got to work with him on SPEED, there was a part of me that was like \"i'm doing a fight scene with Dennis Hopper\" and I said to myself \"My! How extraordinary!\" \n\nHe was just so open, had a wonderful sense of humor and outlook on life that he shared, so it was really cool to have been in his life.  ",
      "Yeah, for me that's something inherited I guess.  How does that happen?  I don't know.  I haven't done anything in particular, I will just go with genetics.  I will just thank my mom and dad and then their parents and then their parents. ",
      "You know, I started to think about directing I guess around 2008?  I think it was just through my life experiences, and I've always as an actor thought about the role in the story, and I just found myself starting to think about telling a story.  And as I developed the screenplay with Tiger for the five years that we did, I originally was not going to direct, but as we kept working on the story, it kind of filled my vision and my heart, and it became the story that I wanted to tell.  And so I directed it.  ",
      "Happy Anniversary, SPEED! \n\n*Hmm.* Well, a fun day once was the day when they let us drive down the street smashing through cars on the bus. And everyone started to scream, hehe, and then laugh when it was over, and it really bonded everyone together. It was early on in the filming, yeah, but it was really fun to be smashing through cars! And with Dennis... gosh, I got to know him over the years and I'd first worked with Dennis on a film called River's Edge, and it was cool to see him again while we were making SPEED. And something that I thought I would never do in my life was have a fight scene with Dennis Hopper on top of a subway car! Heheh! And it was just - it was a *really good day.* He had such a wonderful intelligence and sense of humor. So the chance to spend time with him was one of the highlights of my life. ",
      "*Mmm.*\n\nHave fun! Have fun... that's what Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers said to me, when I sat with him once for a lesson. He said \"*Just play.\"* He said \"Just play and have fun.\"",
      "There was a really great hamburger place called Licks.  I really used to love hanging out by the grade school I used to go to, I played a lot of street hockey and basketball there.  We had wonderful parks, Ramsden Park, we had chestnut fights running around Ramsden Park.  The Bloor Street Cinema, I would go see movies there.  The University Cinema.  ",
      "I've had the opportunity to travel to a few places.  I've never been to Africa, or the Middle East, and I haven't been to Brazil, I haven't really been to South America, I haven't been to any of the ice caps, I think it would be great to go to the North and South Pole.  And cross the Sahara.\n\nThat sounds GOOD!",

      "Um... hi!\n\nYou know, an inspiration for me to start acting was really when I was a young kid was the performances of Peter O'Toole. And in my free time, I tend to work on working, and when I'm not doing that, trying to spend time with friends and family. And I most certainly enjoy a good motorcycle ride. And today for my favorite movie, I will pick - **AHAAHAHAAAAAA I can't decide!** \n\nToday I will pick: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (the original,  not the remake). ",

      "See, I believe there are some black and white films where they have Frankenstein brains in a vat.  Maybe the first brain I saw was in Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein?  Certainly the Matrix Trilogy, I shared so much of the thoughts and perspectives of the story from the writers and directors, and I really loved the moment when the character that I played when he comes up to the moment where he asks the head of the Machines, the Deus Ex Machina, asks him (Neo) what does he want and my character says \"Peace\" and I thought that was wonderful and really something that I agree with, that for all sentient beings this idea of peace. ",
      "You know, I don't have a favorite TV show, but I do know that I love watching The Olympics.  Whenever the Olympics are on, I just love watching them, the moments that you get these incredible athletes dedicating so much of their lives to the moments that happen in the Olympics, and it is great to be able to witness that.",

      "Advice is tough.  If I am asked for advice I will do the best I can.  But I always start off by saying first off \"I hate giving advice.\"  In some way, there's a responsibility to advice that I am scared of.  But I will give advice.  Especially on more practical things.  Like practical advice I'm much more comfortable with.  Life advice, not so much.  What does your heart say? What do you hope to have happen? How are you doing? If something is hurting you, why and how and how can it be changed?  I have had some exposure to Buddhism and some exposure to the Dao, and they certainly have influenced my thought, the experience of compassion and permanence, the idea of the nature of being alive.

      "It's a tough question.  Today I will choose: at that intersection of Hollywood and Gower, the car's not going to stop for the yellow light, so don't go through there.  ",

      "Hmm.\n\nIf I had to choose between Coffee and Tea TODAY, Today I will choose **coffee!**\n\nAnd if it's just straight coffee, I like it with a  little milk or cream, usually no sweetener or no sugar. I like the bitterness. ",
      "My favorite meal?  Today I will pick, since it's Fall, first of all let's start with a caesar salad with the anchovy.  And then we need a baguette on the table.  Then we need some tomato soup with some sharp cheddar cheese in it.  Then we can have a NY steak on the bone with some mashed potatoes and some creamed spinach and a 1982 Margaux.  And then for dessert we'll have some pumpkin pie with some fresh whipped cream.  Yeah, let's do that. \n\nAnd then after all of that we can sit down and have some Armagnac. \n\nMy favorite animal?  Too hard to choose.\n\nI don't know what my favorite place is either!",

      "I do like Breaking Bad.  I really enjoyed that series.  The performances, the writing, the setup and the cinema, the storytelling. It was very engaging.  ",
      "You know, shooting 47 Ronin was a great experience.  It's a story that is very special and close to the Japanese actors, and I could feel that and respected that during the course of the filmmaking.  And it brought another element to the filming, it heightened it even more than it usually is.  Which was great.",
      "No! the band is broken up.  It was a great run.  And we had a lot of fun and a great experience.  But classically we have moved.  ",
      "*HMMMMMM.*\n\nI think sometimes - our dreams can teach us, instruct us, confuse us... sometimes I think they look to be considered. And in terms of like, they are an opportunity and I think they most certainly could be utilized to focus, to try and achieve--whether it's looking for someone, or influencing us, or inspiring us. ",
      "No, starting out, when I first had my professional work when I was 15, I just had the courage of youth, and the passion for what I wanted to do.  I did not know, I had no expectations, I just felt I would be able to do it.  I left home when I was 18, and I didn't know what was going to happen.  I went from Toronto to Los Angeles, I've had breaks, first I got a role in an American movie of the week that was shot in Canada with Lindsay Wagner that helped me get an agent in LA, to make that jump going from Toronto to Los Angeles and Hollywood, I got my first car and drove from Toronto to LA.  I don't know the answer to what sets apart the successful.  You definitely need passion and perseverance, and as an actor, unless you are creating your own material, it's up to other people.  You audition for work and if you have other opportunities where you can create or you can get asked to do work, it's up to other people.  \n\nMy typical day when I am not working is usually working on working, so I have a production company, so I work on developing other stories and other projects, hopefully get to spend some time with some friends, hopefully get to see a movie or a play or something.  In between jobs I am either working on working or trying to spend time with friends and family. ",

      "You know, we made that in a villa in Greve, Italy, and some of the cast was living together, we had this one house, it was great to be working on Shakespeare with Ken, he gave me a voice lesson way back in the beginning, he introduced me to a wonderful vocal teacher, Cicely Barry, and it was interesting to work on a naturalistic approach to the text and the playing of it.  I wish I could have played more of the role from the play of Don John!  It was a great summer.  There was romance, and intrigue both in front of the camera and behind.  Sometimes life imitates art.  Good luck with your production.  ",

You know, I'm a fairly private person, and also I think you can share your private thoughts with your friends using social media, but I have not done that yet.  I tend to do that when I'm with them.

      "Yeah the documentary was exploring different opinions and feelings about digital and film and came to a place that ultimately it is for whatever the storyteller wants to use.  It's really about the story.  For me, I made the documentary because I was interested and concerned about what was going to happen to film, as I looked around and saw that digital was replacing film.  So I started off being a fan of film.  Through the course of the documentary and as technology as gotten better, I miss film and it is very special and unique, but I have also come to the feeling that digital technology is coming to a place that can also tell the story and can be beautiful in its way.

That was a truly great inspiring performance.\n\nIt lifted the film to a whole 'nother level.\n\nAnd for the Rush Rush video, that was a GIFT from the GODS.

I enjoyed going to places and experiencing things that I would never normally do on a holiday. It was actually quite entertaining hanging out with the cast. I’d like to go down to New Zealand again, actually. New Zealand would be the place I’d love to go first and then America.\n\nAs for Karl, there are so many funny experiences, he said plenty of funny things. A lot of them never get in the program because they’re said when we're traveling to the next country. The funniest and most absurd moment was probably when Karl said “Do you have knees?” I was always surprised to learn that Karl really didn’t know anything about me. Like whenever I’d mention I’d been in Harry Potter or Star Wars, he was genuinely shocked and surprised, where I kind of know everything there is to know about Karl from having listened to his program.\n\nI learned to drive a manual I used to have when I was 17, but I do prefer an automatic now because it’s simpler. But driving in Top Gear was the most fun I’ve ever had in a car, and I was amazed at how quickly you can drive a very low-powered production car with Pringles tubes for pedals. ",

      "My first impression of Stephen is that he’s tall. Karl, when I first met him, it was like meeting a legend really. When you meet the man it’s a great experience, but that wears off very quickly when you get to know him. When I met Ricky, he phoned me at home to pitch me the idea of doing an episode of Extras. And when I said “Who is this?” he started laughing, and I knew it must be him, because no one laughs quite like him, do they?",
      "I think it's great to see short actors in more prominent roles. This situation has definitely improved during the span my career. I hope it will continue. ",
      "Yes, we do keep in touch. I saw Karl about 3 weeks ago when he was appearing on a TV show in the UK to promote The Moaning of Life. He told he he was doing some grouting. ",
      "Simon Lane. Because he makes me laugh basically. ",
      "Yes. I need a few more years of experiences behind me first though.",
      "No. Do you? I appreciate every job I do and treat it as it might be the last. As an actor, there is no rule that says you will be employed again. This way, I am always excited when the next role comes in.",

      "Let me think. It’s funny when you try and then can’t think of anything. I mean, its kinda out there a bit, but the characteristics of Wicket in Return of the Jedi were modeled on my pet dog who used to tilt his head from side to side when he heard a strange sound. I felt this would work quite well for the character. Also, the food that Princess Leia gives Wicket by the log was actually one of those healthy but horrible tasting rice cakes. And one final snippet, Wicket’s tongue is not animatronic, its actually my own tongue.",
      "Vanilla.",
      "They both make me laugh, but for different reasons.",

      "Wicket’s voice was actually recorded by a Native American, and I was actually only 17, if that makes me even more amazing. ",
      "I'd love to do more Porridge. I think he's a very interesting character with so much more to offer, after all, he is the emperor of the known universe!",
      "Your own, of course.",
      "Ha, I love that. Karl isn’t stupid, he just sees the world differently and comments on it in the way that I think we’d all like to, except that we filter those thoughts and comments. ",
      "Obviously, the roles for me as a short actor are more limited than for an average size actor. But, I’ve been very conscious in my career to focus on my performance skills, so that when roles do come up, I’m well positioned to audition for them and hopefully get them. ",

      "Never eaten one.",
      "Um. I mean when you say movie series, is that more than one? Can two movies be a series? I think Anchorman, because I think Will Ferrell is fantastic and I love the style and humor in that film I just really love the style of humor the idea that everybody saying ridiculous things but nobody questions how it is, which is pretty unique. These guys-- kind of all the characters seem to accept everything everyone else says as being normal. ",

I think it would be great to do another such special in a year or two and I think that the hour long format works really well. I’d certainly be very interested to see what Warwick was up to and whether or not his career was going in a more positive direction. ",
      "As an 11 year old I was only allowed to work 4 hours and would spend most of that time in at least half of the costume. The Ewok head was only put on for an actual take, and removed in between. So basically we would sit around and sort of sit in the costume between scenes and take the head off between takes. ",
      "Guinness Book of Records and my autobiography. Guinness because it’s fat and my autobiography, because it’s about me. It was a challenge to write, but a fun one, because I was able to recall things I thought I’d forgotten by listening to music from my childhood and speaking to people who had been an influence in my life and career. I recommend everyone should take a daily diary to fully appreciate their lives and their achievements. \n",
      "It's hard to choose 1 moment from 11 years of memories. I had a wonderful experience during that time. My fondest memories are of the people involved in the making of the films.\n",
      "I think that attitude and opportunity for short actors are becoming more diverse and INTERESTING. But there is still a long way to go. I would like to see short actors cast in roles that make no reference to their height. \n\nHearing that your VHS was worn out, I’ve heard that before and it’s incredible. I think the film is so enduring because it has many interesting characters, and it’s a very well realized world and the themes of good vs evil are universal. It’s a great example of a film from that era and one which people are excited to share with their offspring. It’s a generational film.\n",
      "Yeah, I would like to. I don’t tend to watch series like that because it’s takes a lot of time to follow through. So I wouldn’t be able to keep up with that, but I hear great things about that series. I’d love to do it, to work on a show with such high standards of writing and filmmaking would be a delight.",
      "Sometimes I’ll have a great experience on a film because the script is fantastic, other times the experience is good because of the cast and crew. But I can honestly say I’ve enjoyed each and every film I’ve ever appeared in. \n\nThere’s a great script for a film that’s not out yet called Get Santa, that is an example of a great script. \n\nAs for a great cast and crew - that would be Harry Potter. You become very close with all of them because they all mostly worked on all of the movies. I worked on the Harry Potter series for 11 years. ",
      "Meeting my on-screen heros. I didn’t see them for the actors they were, I only saw them as their characters, and being able to chat with them and getting to know them was thrilling for me as an 11 year old Star Wars fan. \n\nI was in awe of George Lucas, but I have to call him a friend, someone who has given me a career as an actor and so many wonderful opportunities.

So you have to really love the performing to stick with it and stick through the times when there isn’t any work.

I said \"I don't *have*\" - what I was talking about when I said that is that my closest friends aren't movie star friends, not that i don't WANT movie star friends. And it depends on your definition of the word \"Friend.\" My close friends are old friends, and none of them happen to be actors. I didn't mean that to say that I wouldn't befriend someone because they were an actor. I just, you know, my close friends *are* old friends. And it also depends on the word friends, and close friends. I have about 2, 3, 4 close friends. And a couple of them I've known since before I was an actor. I guess it sounded like a catchy thing to what the person wanted to say, and also most movie stars or successful actors are busy, so someone's off shooting something else while I'm shooting somewhere else... but it's never been my nature to make fast friends that I could *truly* call my friends.\n\nNow a very, very good friend of mine is a musician. Lenny Kravitz. Wait, he just did an AMA? That's *CRAZY.* Did you mention to him that you were talking to me? That is *crazy.* So I got a superstar friend! Not a movie star friend but a rockstar! But it just so happens that none of my close friends are movie stars, for whatever reason, not because I didn't want them to be.

      "Dogs. Dogs.\n\nCats, man, they're too independent. They piss me off. they play when they want, and then they turn their back on you. Dogs, you throw the ball, and they bring it back, tongue hanging out, tail wagging. Cats are like \"Not right now, too busy.\" Definitely a dog man. ",
      "Well, I'd like to think that I, you know, try to do the right thing. I don't emulate the character that I'm playing, this is life, I don't say \"Oh, what would Robert McCall do\" -but there's a part of me in every role i play. And there's things you learn, not just from shooting the movie, but also from the experience with the people you shoot the movie with. There are lessons learned from shooting movies, but I couldn't give you a specific example. ",
      "I've learned so much from so many of them, I wouldn't pick one. I mean I love Tony Scott, God rest his soul. I've had great success with Spike and Ed Swick. Obviously great success with Antoine Fuqua, those are the ones that I just mentioned. I love and miss Tony. One of the best filmmakers is really...I'm going to say everybody and all the ones I leave out are going to be pissed but...c’est la vie. That's a good group right there. I'm sure I left out somebody. ",
      "But you know who I really dug? When I was on vacation a few years back, and I sat, and I said I'm going to watch The Incredibles. *MAN* that is one of my favorite movies of all time now!\n\nDid you ever see INCREDIBLES? I love that movie!",
      "Oooh! Cherry Vanilla! If I had to pick 3: Cherry Vanilla is first. But then either Chocolate or Butter Pecan, Haagen-Daaz, or Mister Softee for those in New York, small cone. ORIGINAL Mister Softee, not the fake-out trucks! Mister Soft! Master Softee! They got 'em in New York! no, the *original* Mister Softee. Gotta be very specific. ",
      "Go to college. Graduate. Learn to read, write and count. One thing is to make money, another thing is to count it. ",
      "But I definitely would. When I was a kid, THE EXORCIST scared the bejeezus out of me. That was a crazy movie. Yeah, I'd love to do a horror movie. And why does the girl always fall down in front of the monster? She always trips and falls JUST in time for the monster to get her. What's up with that? Maybe that's just the old movies. Maybe she doesn't fall down as much any more. ",
      "I don’t play ball anymore, those days are over, and I grew up in a town called Mount Vernon NY, and as you know coming from Brooklyn we had some good ball players, like the Williams brothers, Gus won a championship with Seattle, his brother Ray was a point guard for the Knicks. The most famous person…well I’ve hung up my knees so my ball days are over, so I didn’t get a chance to play with the president, that would be interesting. Cause he kept saying he was gonna serve me, and the NY ego was like hey you better check with us down here, check with the knees. \n\nI don’t know who is super big. When I first got to LA, the hollywood high school they would have different celebrities, but a lot of the biggest named guys didn’t play, they just talked a lot. Arsenio played, but not a big big star. Who is the best movie star player? I rest my case. My days are over. In my time it was me, hahaha. ",
      "One of the challenges were the transitions. In a play it's lights out, the curtain comes. You can't do that but it opened up other opportunities to stay with the character that were left on stage in the play. It was a process. It was a slow process. Was anything lost or gained? Yea, probably! That's just the nature of it. You might lose a little, it’s a motion picture now. Some of the story is just told in what you see. You won't have to say it all. ",
      "That's what you call Champagne Problems. You know Romo is ready to go, I'm sure he's looked at all the footage from Peyton Manning last year, it's his turn. I think you stick with the horse right now and allow Tony to continue to heal. He'll be ready, he is ready, and right now he's an asset. He's the best thing for him right now, to work with him and he seems to be very unselfish about it. I like what the owner is saying, he says, \"I'll know it when I see it”\n\nCall me Jerry. ",
      "MEOW!",

I'm in the book of Ezekiel right now, a lotta drama going on. Proverbs is always a good chapter, a good book, because there are always some gems in there that you can apply. Chronicles, also. ",

      "Tony was the best. You know? Tony would, he would curse one second, and cry the next. He wore his heart outside of his shirt. You knew how he felt. He was a very passionate and great filmmaker. Totally unafraid. And I really miss him. I just put a picture up, of him, in my room, in my study in my house, and I actually had to cover it up because it was too difficult to look at him. It's almost like he was looking at the camera, like he was looking at me, and I just really miss him. ",

I have the tailor-made suits I wore in Training Day, I have those and the leather jacket. I go home with *something.* ",
      "Oh, I dug it! I got a chance to work with Delta airlines, I got in their flight simulators - we simulated takeoffs, not landings, because we were crashing the plane anyways... like I said, I have a great job. I get to be a pilot one day, Malcolm X the next, I get to drive a train (which I got to learn on UNSTOPPABLE - I drove a train for 40 miles or something, you don't have to turn! all you gotta do is follow the lights and keep the speed right and it's a drill).

      "1) Well, when my children - I first returned, I did a Shakespeare in the park, back in 1990, and then I was gone for 15 years until 2005. I did Julius Caesar. And the main reason was because you do 8 shows a week in New York, and I couldn't commute to LA. I didn't want to be away from my wife and my children for that long period of time in their lives, it's 5, 6 months. So until they got old enough, I didn't do any Broadway shows, but as of 2005, I've done 3 in the last few years - in 2010, I did FENCES, and I just finished A RAISIN IN THE SUN. And in the next 3 or 4 years, I plan to go back, if not sooner. \n\n2) I'd fight it to the end. I'm not going to give in. So I wouldn't even be thinking of a final meal. That would mean I gave up. If I'm innocent, I'm going kicking and screaming the whole way. My final meal would be whomever's trying to put the handcuffs on me!",
      "Yes, but I would never say! Because that wouldn't be fair to the people that made the movie. And then there are films that I don't like, and then someone will come up to me and say it's their favorite movie. The movies belong to the people. You make them and you put them out there. For me, I love the process of making films. For me, my favorite film is always my next one. ",
      "Mhmm, the Brad Pitt role. I don't regret but that is one that I was wrong. ",

      "Ya...Out of all the roles? I don't have one. I would want people to remember what they choose to remember. I like Glory and a movie that pops into my head. Wow for atmosphere, I wouldn't say because I wouldn't want to piss of any directors. Depends upon the film.",

      "It was the University of Pennsylvania. And I need to go look at that speech again myself, you know?\n\nBut don't be afraid.\n\nDon't be afraid.\n\nIf you're passionate about something, then do what you love. Not what you think you have to do. There's life, and then there's making a living. And life is short, so you want to feel passionate about whatever it is you do in life. And sometimes it requires great sacrifice, or you may not be as successful in some people's eyes, financially or otherwise. But do what you love, what you're passionate about. \n\nAnd I don't have a favorite. I would never pick one, you know. And people ask me what my favorite movie is, I always say my next one, because I enjoy *making* the movie - each experience is different. And you may have, sometimes it's the character, sometimes it's the movie itself, sometimes it's the people you met, sometimes it's the filmmaker - I couldn't dare pick just one. I remember when I landed my first role, in a movie called Carbon Copy - and even before that, it was a TV movie, because I was still in college, and I landed a role in a TV movie called Wilma, I played a boyfriend who became her husband, and I couldn't believe it. You know, when you're young, when you're starting out, it's still thrilling but not quite like that. Wilma Rudolph was the fastest woman in the olympics in the 1960's. And probably faster than 90% of the guys too. ",

      "1) Oh, great. Tom is the best. Tom is the funniest, and most talented, I think I've ever worked with, one of the most. Just a great talent, and obviously, the world knows that.\n\n2) Everything. I go from classical to NAS to whatever, Jay-Z, to R&B, you know. Sometimes I just put my iPod - I have multiple iPods with all kinds of crazy music on them - I might go from Led Zeppelin to Rachmaninoff  - just all over the place when it comes to music. And it depends what mood I'm in -if I'm on my way to the gym, I want something up-tempo. I like 1970's music, Earth Wind & Fire. A lot of hiphop. \n\n3) No, I haven't, and I would love to go. Are you inviting me? Meet me at the airport! Pick me up at the airport!",
      "I have been through Halifax, I think. But I've never spent any time there. Looks like it's nice, but to be honest, haven't spent any time there. And I am on my way to Toronto in about 45 minutes! I'll let you know when I get there. But we did The Hurricane there, John Q, we filmed the Bone Collector in Montreal.. I want to hit Calgary, go to Western Canada. I like Canadians, they're very civilized. ",
      "I do the best one. But who do you think?",
      "I'm sure. I remember years ago, I think I was in DC, a guy almost had me auditioning (he didn't believe it was me)...auditioning to be me!",
      "I enjoyed, actually - there's a big speech I make at the end, where everybody's walking out on me - King John ain't got nothing on me speech. That section was interesting. And doing the research, because i got to spend a lot of time with Crips and Bloods, and kind of get under the surface and find out what they're about and all that kind of stuff. ",
      "Yes i did! My career started at camp Sloane, in Lakeville, Connecticut. The counselors put a talent show on for the kids. Is it still open? ",
      "HA! I just did it in instinctively! I didn't prepare for it at all! I was trying to dance as bad as I could. You must be an older person, if you knew that was The Popeye. Yeahhhh, I haven't heard that, man that is going *back.* But that's what they called that dance! ",
      "Yes I felt typecast sometimes, and for any actor rejection. I was always at my best in auditions when I already had a job. I used to call it a smell. You walk in with a smell cause you’re too hungry, you’re thirsty, and they can smell it, but when you’re working you’re like hey I got 15 minutes I gotta go do that. \n\nI think Pharoah’s impression is more like the, I don’t know it was an impression of an impression.",
      "The script. That's where it all starts and all ends. ",
      "I think that it's gotten a little better - hopefully for women, although they still lag behind. And I achieve not being typecast - the most important thing I've done to shape my career is not taking certain films. I refused to be pigeonholed, especially early on - I tell young actors, as was told to ME by a great actor - the first 4 or 5 films that you do will determine how you are perceived in this business, so sometimes you have to say no. So I said no early on a lot, and left a lot of money on the table, because I didn't want to compromise. I tell young actors \"if you don't feel comfortable doing it, don't do it\" - sometimes it's not easy, to walk away from the money. ",
      "That's a tough one. You know, I hate to take a look out the window and think I could jump out like Superman, like Clark... hmmm, I always dug Thor in the comic books. Somewhere between Superman and Thor. ",

      "Oooh! The Bible. ",
      "Oh - if you're a guy - two phrases. One is \"yes, dear\"  and the other is \"honey, you're right.\" Be patient. Be good friends first. And stick together. You gotta work at it. I've been married 31 years. It's not all a honeymoon, it's not all flowers and roses, but if you're friends and partners and committed, you'll be okay. And everybody's got advice for you - don't listen. ",
      "You can google Denzel at Camp Sloane. ",
      "Oh, it was great. He was just such a sweet, nice man. A gentle person. And really gave me a lot of confidence at a young age. And that was my first Academy Award nomination, was Cry Freedom. Just a wonderful human being as well as filmmaker. ",

      "I'm not. The characters are not me. ",
      "Well, one of the differences, with alcohol, it was American-based, so we had, more, I guess, control over the flow (no pun intended). The drug trade is a whole different animal. First of all, there wouldn't be a drug trade without a customer. And there are a lot of customers. And it's an international issue, for the most part. I guess a lot of marijuana is grown in the United States... I guess we'd have to track the statistics in Colorado and see if marijuana-related crime has gone up or down, it's a good guinea pig for that. ",

      "You know, I don't really look at myself. I watch the movies ONCE so that I know what I'm talking about, but I don't really study them... I'm more excited about what I'm going to do, than what I've done. I don't really analyze. I've said it earlier, but movies belong to the people, so movies that I don't think were as good, people have said it's their favorite one of mine, I don't grade them, I don't rate them. Plus it wouldn't be fair to the filmmaker. ",

And the whip was wet and it was starting to hurt. So some of that was real. I was telling the guy \"don't be a chump,\" and he started to hit me hard, but it was just acting. ",

Like \"Okay, I'm done.\" And without any fanfare, gone. ",
      "I like 'em all! You know? I like switching it up. You see, sometimes it might seem I do more action, especially in the last 2-3 years, because I do plays - I do really dramatic roles onstage, like I did a play called FENCES, in fact i won the Tony award for FENCES, and i Just finished a really dramatic role for RAISIN IN THE SUN. And next year we're shooting a cowboy movie, a Western. I start riding horses the first day of October! I'll be ridin' for 5 months in preparation. See what I mean? I get to ride trains, fly planes, ride horses, AND they pay me?!",
      "Well, they're sort of all intertwined. As an actor, just being able to portray the different roles, to walk into these different lives, you know? Like this guy in The Equalizer, or Malcolm X, or to do something silly - as a director, to just collaborate and put great talent around you, not just the actors but cinematographers, editors, music, it's a total collaboration with every aspect of the filmmaking process. And the producer part comes into play with both of them. As an actor, you're producing a character. As a director, you're producing a film! You're making a film. And then there's different kinds of producers - there are creative producers, I look at myself as one. There are producers that go out and raise the money (I'm not that guy). There are people who are very good at that. I didn't have to go out and raise the money to make the films. ",
      "I would like to! I have a project that I may direct in the next probably two years.\n\nI want to get back to it.

Usually with fresh juices they don't last long, but I couldn't drink them all when I came to Miami, I hope they last until I get home.

Gay actors of his generation were subject to shameful treatment.\n\nA characteristic I like most about Freddy and his partner Stuart is their longevity. They are survivors who deserve all the happiness they can get in their later years. Perhaps they liked being vicious to each other because the world has been vicious to them.",

Each part will have its challenges and I like that because if you're trying to solve a problem you're fully engaged.\n\nI think in Mr. Holmes I do every so often a sort of acting I admire in others. But I've never met an actor who thought he was any good, really. But we are perhaps the last people to judge our own performances. ",

Why the Mob has such a rich history in garbage-related industries and rendering-related industries is a conversation beyond my pay grade.\n\nI only know how relieved I was to finally find a rendering outfit that was not owned or operated by the *Cosa Nostra.*\n\nThat facility was in Northern California.

This would be able an $800,000 project if our grant application is approved by New York State.\n\nOther things that come to mind are a $400,000 proposal for an overlook/public space that ties into our busiest intersection (11,000 cars a day pass through it) as well as a program that we implemented this past year which asks tax exempt organizations to voluntarily contribute to the Village as they don't pay taxes. Some folks don't like the idea but I'm proud that we have implemented it as I truly believe that it can help bolster the Village's finances. \n\nI'd say Halo: CE is the best all around Halo.

      "I really enjoy Upstate New York and I really like where I live. Whitney Point is centrally located between Syracuse, Binghamton, Ithaca and several other major cities aren't very far away. The Pennsylvania border is 30 minutes away. So there's a lot within a short drive. In general I like the low key life that comes with living in a rural area like upstate New York. I can get where I want, when I want. The people tend to be great neighbors and Whitney Point specifically has a really tight-knit feeling of community and belonging.\n\nAs far as heroin goes, yes, we are struggling with addiction and have seen many tragedies in its wake. There are a number of organizations and groups working to get those struggling help, prevent use and get help but it's something unlike anything I've ever seen. It really takes over your life once you've used it and it's incredibly difficult to stop. \n\nFrom our perspective in Whitney Point, the challenge is resources. It's not like a city where the Department of Health, rehab and hospital are right down the road. We're 30 minutes away from anything like that. We're more isolated. So the challenge is to make those connections and bring resources to the local level so people can get help and so prevention and awareness programming can occur. So that's what we've been doing. We've been holding events, building awareness, educating the public, etc. Our firefighters now carry Narcan to wake overdose victims who are unresponsive and we have a local Narcotics Anonymous group here in the Village now.

      "I first ran for office in 2008 when I was 21. I ran for County Legislature and I got my butt kicked, but I met a lot of local residents and learned a lot. I ran again in 2010 and lost again, but worked even harder and learned even more. Shortly after that election the Mayor of the Village at the time called me and asked me to join the Board of Trustees when a member had resigned due to a serious accident. So I served on the board for several years and then ran for Mayor in 2015 when the sitting Mayor decided to retire. ",
      "The first time I ran I had absolutely no experience. I had actually began organizing and getting involved with the local Democratic Party and I happened to meet the Chairman of the party at the time at a rally that I had organized on my own out of the blue. He asked me if I had ever considered running for office and I told him that I had. It had been my dream for a while to do so, but I never thought that the opportunity would come so soon. So I met with him, he explained an opportunity that was out there and I took on the challenge. \n\nAnd it was a major challenge. I ran as a Democrat in a district that was 2:1 Republican. And I lost big. But the experience that I gained was well worth it. I met so many people, learned about what they do, learned different things about government and the history of our area, etc. \n\nSo if you're looking to get involved yourself that's what I would recommend. Start attending local government meetings, start getting involved with whatever party that you're a member of (If you are a member of a party) and just start being active. Don't wait for someone to approach you, just go out there and do things you think need to be done. The doors will open. ",

It blows my mind. \n\nAs for the hemp industry, I honestly haven't put a lot of research into it but I think that in general, we do need to open up more economic doors. We can't forge companies like IBM to come back here. That ship has sailed. We have to create new opportunities. Hemp seems like it could be one of those, as could the medical marijuana industry. Instead of trying so hard to fight the current and keep old business models around, let's open up the doors to new ones. I think that's the key to economic growth in New York State. ",

I have a serious amount of respect for everyone that does. Yes, I'm a Mayor and that's a big responsibility but so is caring for a human life and being responsible for their development. I often see friends from high school and they'll be like \"Wow, you're the Mayor, that must be so much work!\" And I'll reply \"You have three kids, that has to be just as much, if not more work!\" It's all about perspective, priorities and efficient use of time.

      "The biggest thing that I wish we could change about Whitney Point? Simple things. I'd like to see some buildings fixed up. I'd like to see sidewalk constructed in areas where we currently don't have any. I'd like to see some new businesses (like the Point Motel to be sold to a new developer). Things like that.\n\nFinancials are always a challenge. We have no shortage of ideas for projects to improve the Village, it's finding the money to make them reality that's the tricky part. That's why for large scale projects, we always look for state or federal funding. We simple cannot ask the 900-some residents who pay property taxes here to constantly fund large scale projects. Whitney Point has been very fortunate and received a number of grants in the last decade or so that have made a huge impact here. \n\nAs for actual changes in implementation, in 2016 we implemented the PILOT program tax exempt entities that I would like to see grow and become ingrained in the Village operation. And ideally I would also like to see some of the Village's reserve funds grow so that the Village can remain prepared for rainy economic days, major catastrophes and large projects. Obviously we aren't just going to jack everyone's taxes up in order to do that, we have to find more creative ways.\n\nOne of the things that we're currently working on is implementing some changes to our zoning code which will create a unified process for the installation of solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations in residential garages. NYSERDA is offering $5,000 in incentives for us to do so. That's how we have to work for our taxpayers. We have to find little ways to save money and boost revenues every way that we can. There are no grandiose silver bullets that I have found. \n\nAs far as the funding goes, we try to take advantage of the programs that the state offers. To my knowledge there aren't any grants that we can apply for that would net our school district $800,000 to bolster educational programs. The school district can certainly seek grants but as a Mayor of a municipal government, I'm not authorized to apply for them. That said, I do believe that education and housing are two of the best investments that the public can make. That's why I'm very excited about the $500,000 housing rehabilitation grant that we have been awarded. The improvements made through the grant will directly improve quality of life for our residents who receive money to fix their homes, the Village's presentation will improve and property values will increase. All long term benefits. That's the definition of investment.\n\nAs for the look out/public space, that's a qualify of life improvement that we think will attract more people to Whitney Point. When you drive through and see it you'll say, \"This looks like a nice place to live.\" It will make you want to come back. It will make you consider us when you're looking for a new home. I think it would be a good investment for NYS to fund. \n\nSo that said, we can only take advantage of the programs that are out there. If NYS wants to change the programs that are available, that is their choice. But if I'm told that NYS is looking to fund building rehab, we're going to try to take advantage of that rather than let the money go elsewhere. We want to bring it to our community and to our residents, who pay NYS taxes like everyone else. \n\nAs for the specific grades, I don't have info on the criteria used but I often find the criteria used isn't suitable to smaller communities. That said, the costs of living here are extremely affordable and crime is low because we truly have a lot of great, caring people here. We all know each other and look out for each other. As for education receiving an F, I disagree with that. I went to high school here and while I know of a lot of challenges that the public education system is facing financially, I think we have a lot of teachers that provide a level of interest in their students to put them over the top and equip them to the best of their ability. I think most of NYS' educational challenges are more systemic than local. \n\nIf I was going to give you a reason to visit Whitney Point it would be this; Live here. The costs of living are low, crime is low, we have a great geographical location and we really are a community that cares for its own. That's what makes Whitney Point a great place to live. \n",

      "That's great. Our program isn't mandatory, it's optional. We recognize that not all non-profits can afford to contribute to the Village's operations but we're asking and we're hoping that the program grows over the years. I think it means a lot that any local tax payer can see where their tax money is going and I hope that tax exempt entities who can afford it can feel good about helping to fund the local fire department or sidewalk repairs, etc. ",

      "Right now I'm really into Overwatch and Destiny. Since launch I've put over 1,000 hours into Destiny. I love it and have high hopes that the sequel will fix many of the original games flaws.

      "I think a lot of recent developments in government are the result of the baby boomer generation's last hurrah. They feel strongly about certain things and have come out in full force to voice their opinions recently, while a lot of young people have taken a lot for granted the last few years. \"Politics\" is always about who's talking, who's communicating best and who's got the strongest, most effective message that relates to the most people. I am hopeful that more young people will step up and take stands for what they think is right in the future. But something that's absolutely vital is that no matter who you are, that you educate yourself and get the right information. Being the loudest in the room doesn't make you the smartest or most well rounded. It's important that people educate themselves, view things from multiple angles and then put their thoughts and views into action and make them more than just Facebook rants. Anyone can make a difference, especially at the local level. ",
      "I would generally agree with that statement. Mayors, Town Supervisors, Trustees, Councilman, etc often have a direct view at what is affecting their residents and their community. You also have the opportunity to make changes that will have potentially immediate and direct effects as well. Which is both a great opportunity and responsibility. \n\nI think having that understanding of what's happening around you at street level is very important and makes a huge difference. It gives you an awareness, sense of urgency and helps you understand the importance of something. When your neighbor tells you that they need a grant to help fix their roof because its caving in, you can look and see it and say \"Wow, these people are sleeping in a house that's 45 degrees. This is serious.\" No offense to anyone serving in higher levels of government at all because they have important but different jobs as well, but being able to see something tangible with your own eyes is different than receiving a letter or a phone call. It's just reality.\n\nAs for common misconceptions between levels of government it does happen all the time but I often find things the other way around. People think that if it happens within the boundaries of the Village that the local government must have control over it, when often it is a county or state project for example. We're very lucky to have great relationships with our county, state and federal representatives and have had success quite a bit whenever we make a request on behalf of our residents but every now and then someone makes a really unreasonable request and unfortunately we can't help them because of jurisdiction or its just not feasible. ",
      "That has never crossed my mind, although we have pursued a skatepark in the past. Being a rural area, youth have to make their own fun a lot of times which gives us a fair amount of skateboarders and bikers. I used to be one myself. I've always believed that if you give people a place to go and somewhere to practice their craft and be constructive, they will do so. The challenge is finding a suitable piece of land and funding. Thus far, we have not. ",
      "I would generally characterize my reaction as disbelief. I have always considered it a great honor to serve the public and something to be generally honored and respected, even when you disagree with the people serving. As long as they act in a respectful manner and try to do what they believe is right, I can have some basic level of respect for them, even if I despise their policies and proposals. \n\nWhat scares me now is that there is a person in charge who has no consistent way of thinking. He's short on patience, has no experience making decisions that effect a large pool of people and has never been accountable to anyone but himself. Sometimes I think its good to upset the apple cart. Sometimes a radical shift in perspective or tactics can be good. But I don't have confidence that this is the shift that our country needs and I'm not sure that a lot of people will understand that and/or the repercussions of it for years to come. ",

People ask me that national stage question all the time. \"Do you plan on running for higher office?\" \"What are you going to run for next?\" My answer is always this; Right now, I'm focused on being the best Mayor that I can be. We have a lot of very important projects and initiatives that we're working on and the list is always growing. The work is never done. And I really enjoy my job. I really do. It certainly has challenges and stresses like any job but at the end of the day, being there to help people and try to better your community is extremely gratifying. So right now, I'm focusing on driving Whitney Point and Northern Broome County forward and seeing through a lot of things that our board and I have started. Obviously I also have opinions about state and national level issues and you never say \"never\" to any potential opportunities in the future. Once thing is for certain and that is that I love public service and I want to keep doing it and serving this community and the people here and around us for a long time. ",
      "I'd recommend attending public meetings. Attend your Village Board, Town Council, City Council, County Legislature meetings. Whatever the area that you're interested in, go and educate yourself. Speak your mind where you think it's necessary. And then don't be afraid to take ownership when it is needed. A lot of people often have this mindset that someone will roll out the red carpet for them to run for office. It doesn't usually work that way. If you want to do it, you should do it, no matter what anyone else says. Call your local Board of Elections, call your local party Chairman and ask for help running for the office of your choice. It can be done and if you work hard, it will happen. You just have to stay vigilant and always keep educating yourself. Show that you care. ",

      "At this point in time I would be opposed to consolidating with the Town of Triangle of dissolving the Village and here's why; The Village provides many essential services for our residents. Water, sewer, fire protection, trash pick up, code enforcement, roads, sidewalks and many more. We have a long history of being very fiscally responsible and holding the line on taxes, doing more with less and that goes back a long time. It's not me taking credit for anything, it has everything to do with my predecessors and the way they handled finances and left the Village in good shape. But because of those specifics and the Village's history of sound management of finances and the services that it provides, I think the the services are in better hands when they're in the hands of those who have the experience managing them and can point to a sound record. This is no offense to anyone in the Town of Triangle operation, it just doesn't make sense to me to take what is essentially over a million dollars a year in taxpayer funded services and put them in the hands of a group that may be good at what they do, but frankly is accustomed to a much smaller scope of service and and smaller operations than the Village handles. I'm not convinced that there would be any significant savings there. I'm not opposed to consolidations across the board mind you, I just think in our particular situation, it doesn't make sense.\n\nWe are involved in a great number of shared services that I think do save taxpayers money. We partner with the Town of Triangle on street maintenance, our municipal offices and fire protection. We also partner with the Town of Barker on fire protection and the Village of Lisle on water service. Shared services can certainly be a good thing and save money where it's viable and we're always willing to look at options. ",
      "The Village of Whitney Point is fairly small, that is correct. As of the 2010 census we had less than 1,000 people. However, many people view \"Whitney Point\" as a much larger area as our school district spans a large geographical area. As a municipal government we provide services outside of our borders such as fire protection (We have a volunteer fire department which the Village manages) and we also provide water service for hundreds of properties outside the Village, as well as some sewer hook ups outside of our borders. In short, our scope is service goes far beyond our borders. ",
      "I don't think so. Whitney Point is a small Village where most of us know each other. Most people don't go to vote in a local election of this size and vote without knowing who they are voting for. They make a conscious decision to vote for the candidate of their choice. That's my opinion anyway. ",

I do find it disappointing however that we didn't get much background on Aksis. He seems like a really intimidating and scrupulous foe. \n\nReally looking forward to Destiny 2. I think Bungie has been extremely limited by their game engine and that when they apply the lessons that they've learned with Destiny and it's expansions, Destiny 2 will be a greatly superior game.

      "Again, I'm not an expert on the topic but I generally agree. Colorado has received a great economic boon by legalizing marijuana and their society hasn't devolved because of it. Just like alcohol, if legalized, marijuana shouldn't be allowed to be used in public, which is often something I think people incorrectly assume will happen. I also think that it is a great waste of taxpayer money and resources to be putting people who get caught with small amounts of marijuana through court and then jailing them. That is costly and I don't think it's a benefit to taxpayers or society to be doing it. ",

      "Well I haven't met any White Walkers and I don't have a Direwolf so...In all seriousness, politics doesn't play too big a role here at the local level. It's about getting things done for people. Things like fixing the sidewalk on this street, helping connect this family to a resource that will benefit them, etc. There isn't too much drama or deal making or anything like that at the local level. Village government really is street level. You can walk outside and point to the things that your tax dollars are going to. Streets, sidewalks, water service, sewer, fire service, code enforcement, etc. I like that element of it. ",
      "I've never really had a problem with supporting, I do it more than any other role in a lot of games, but I do like to mix things up.

Educate yourself on the issues, be honest, listen to people, relate to them and work hard. You will eventually prove to people that you mean business and you're worthy of a chance to succeed. ",

Bungie did a great job showing how powerful he is but an awful job allowing his character to contribute to the story. The return of Osiris should have been a big deal. There should have been implications. Instead the plot was self contained like a filler episode of a television series. I'm fine with Osiris choosing not to come back to the city but he couldn't have shared any major news or ideas about what lays ahead or what needs to happen for humanity to push forward? Nothing. He helped us defeat the Vex and made his exit. Thats not story worthy of the most hyped guardian of all time.",

We need to make sure that the costs of living are reasonable. We need to make sure that there are viable careers here. We need to make sure that the education here is solid so that when a young couple wants to start a family, they have confidence in the system in place. And we need quality of life things like solid entertainment and recreation.

One of the things we and others have tried to do to counter this over the years is to establish satellite services or offices. For example, we have a DMV office here a few days a week now. I worked with a local community college a few years back to have college courses taught at our local high school at night. We've asked for various boosts in enforcement from the NYS Police when a concern rises as we don't have our own Village police force. We've established our own Narcotics Anonymous group because it's not convenient for someone struggling to have to drive 30 minutes there and 30 minutes back to get the support they need. This same principle applies to a lot of things. I'd say that is one of the biggest challenges. Connecting the dots for people to get access to resources that they need so they can find good employment, stay healthy, care of their families, etc.\n\nAs far as the actual Village operation goes, I'd say finances.

Other times there will be very intimate elections that are separated by only 10 votes (like mine). Something to consider when running for office and how \"easy\" or \"hard\" it will be is voter registration. If you're a Democrat running in an area that's 2 to 1 Democrat to Republican, it's not going to be extremely hard to win, and vice versa. But I'd always recommend working as hard as you can to get elected. You establish relationships throughout your campaign, learn things and it will make you a better elected official in the end. ",

I'd like to see the Wilcox Building project funded and see that building's restoration completed.

There's just so much. We could go on all day. \n\nAs for dominant political ideologies? I'd say equality is a big one. Activism, engagement, awareness and education are important. Proactively pushing projects along is an important element of my management style.

      "I think the biggest problem that the Democratic Party had in 2016 is that the message wasn't strong. No one really knew what it meant to be running as a Democrat in 2016 except that you weren't Donald Trump. Democrats need to hone their message by outlining their priorities with very specific plans that people can see the value in and relate to. It will be interesting to see which way the Democratic Party goes policy wise in the wake of these election results but I think that you will see more bold proposals and programs coming. NYS Governor Cuomo's proposal for \"tuition free\" college at SUNY schools comes to mind. Let's not get into details, but I think you will see more things like that. \n\nAs for what I will personally do to support labor, that is a great question. Being a Mayor is more street level so I take it from a standpoint of \"What can I do to increase our residents quality of life?\" Investments in our housing like the half million dollar grant that we have been awarded make a huge difference for working class families and that's something that I think is a very sincere result that benefits everyone. And while it is only for our own full-time employees in the Village, we recently updated our employee benefits policy to include paid parental leave for both male and female employees. A small token, but one I'm proud of.\n\nI will think about what you said about the working class and if you have any specific suggestions, I'd love to hear them. ",

It's low key, the costs of living are low, we have a lot for such a small place, decent schools, and there are a lot of other resources around us that aren't very far away. Overall though I would say it's the Village's shared character and people that make it special. ",
      "1. I am considered part-time and on average, it is a part-time job although you're always on duty and always balancing multiple things. My phone is attached to my hand. I juggle both jobs by being as time efficient as possible and by frankly performing Mayoral duties all the time whether I'm in the office or not. We once had a high speed chase and man hunt in the Village while I was in a car on vacation with my girlfriend. I spent much of the car ride answering people's questions on Facebook, posting updates, talking to the police on the phone, etc. You have to do what you have to do and you just have to remember that your duties to your residents are always on-going. It also helps to have family, friends and a spouse/partner who is supportive and understanding. I'm very lucky in that regard.\n2. I ran because I truly do love Whitney Point and I felt that I could lead us forward, propose new ideas and projects and take us to where we need to go at this moment in time. I felt capable of doing the job and excited at the prospect o fit. \n3. I have great working relationships with all of my colleagues. While not everyone always agrees with me and I don't always agree with everyone else, we generally have great discussions and respect each other. I think we all know that we all care about our community, even when we disagree on what's best. We have a mutual respect there and it helps us a governing body. I think we also recognize that we all bring something different to the table.\n4. I do agree with the idea of Villages in New York and I'll tell you why. Our Village in particular provides essential services to our residents at very reasonable prices. Our water and sewer prices are well below the state average. Our property taxes are generally lower than many of our municipal peers. We have a volunteer fire department that is very dedicated, well managed and efficient. While there is always room for improvement and new methods, I am very confident that we offer our tax payers a high level of services at very reasonable rates. I don't believe that dissolving the Village and laying those operations in the hands of a mystery body would benefit our residents. \n5. I go out all the time. Most of our residents feel comfortable reaching out to me on Facebook or emailing me when they need something and often note that I am very quick to respond. I actually like that and pride myself on that. People need to know that you're there for them. The only times that I really like to be isolated are when I'm at the gym, relaxing playing a videogame, watching a movie for the first time, or something along those lines. I like that people feel connected with their government and elected officials and I think that's important. ",

If you want to serve in government I would recommend majoring in something like Public Administration, Business or something like that. The con of a Political Science degree is that it doesn't really \"qualify\" you for many things. It grants you a very capable way of thinking of weighing perspectives, but it doesn't \"train\" you with any skills that people outside of the political/governmental realm tend to value. If you want to get a job in government of politics, I'd highly recommend internships, volunteering and networking every chance you get to build connections and a resume. ",

First of all, there aren't a lot of people who oppose things like students staying on their parents health insurance longer, the ban on insurance companies discriminating against those with pre-existing conditions, etc. I almost support low to no cost birth control and I think most see the value in that.\n\nWhere most people have an issue is the cost. And you can't really argue that many costs have gone up. They have. But why have they gone up? In my totally unprofessional, uneducated opinion it's because the policies that are available are actually worth a damn now. Before Obamacare you could buy a cheap insurance policy that didn't really do much for you. If something serious happened they'd just boot you from the policy and you'd be out in the cold. Now, you're being offered polices that cost more because they are worth more. If you go to the store and you want a bag of Doritos you can get a small bag for $1.49. But if you want more Doritos you need the bigger bag, which costs $4.00. You're paying more because you're getting more.\n\nNow I'm not saying that the cost part is right or wrong for anyone. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Do you think the market should be free to offer whatever policies they want or do you want guarantees that drive the price up? That's up to each individual. I just think there's a massive disconnect and a lot of incorrect information out there that's lead us to this point one way or another. \n\n",

The best thing that any leader of any kind can do (in my opinion) is really think through the decisions that you make. Listen to what others say and have to offer, but trust your long term vision. Even if it seems to be an unpopular opinion at the time, if you know that the end product will bring a benefit to your community, go forward with it and keep explaining to people why its so important. \n\nI'd be lying if I said that I don't have days where the comments or beliefs of others don't make me question myself or make me feel bad or shake my confidence for a short period of time.

      "It is pretty decent but it still bothers me that we're fighting a GOD and he spends large portions of the fight just sitting there letting himself be shot at. He also says nothing the entire fight which bothers me. \n\nAnd yes, the ease at which we dispatched a Worm God was also a massive failure and oversight. ",
      "I will be seeing them in 6 days for the 3rd time. I have personally been dreading an If I had a Tail opening. It's not that I don't like the song it's just not really an exciting song to come out to. Any thoughts on it for those who have seen it as the show opening song?",
      "Radical Heights servers are to remain online for the foreseeable future. The studio has been closed down, however.",
      "Yes and no. Look at a game like Diablo 3. While it sold gang busters, it was universally received as mediocre and disappointing in nearly every regard. The game wasn't fun, wasn't rewarding, didn't tell a compelling story, had server issues and a controversial real-life auction house. A year later it was updated to be known as one of the best ARPG's of all-time. Granted, Blizzard is a world class developer that literally no one can match but it is possible to turn a game around with the right amount of committment, vision and budget. But without the budget, all the commitment, talent and vision in the world don't matter. ",
      "Agreed. It was a mistake to partner with Nexon. ",
      "Such an underrated track. I hope they start playing it live again soon.",
      "Do you have a source on that? I know we will be able to earn them through the protocol when it releases but I haven't found anything about being able to withdraw on Sliver. ",
      "We will never be able to pull our Theta out of Sliver right? We can only give it to streamers?",
      "I agree that Bungue has really done an awful job of realizing the lore and the consequences of the universe in Destiny. I have spent hundreds of hours listening to really in depth, interesting and mysterious lore and sat there satiating for the day that lore comes to fruition in the game. Dealing with entities like Nokris, the Worm Gods, the Wish Dragons etc...These are things that I have been waiting years for. And then we just mindlessly roll through them in 5 minutes? They never explain what they're even up to or give us any real information on them. As a fan, it really hurts to see that the developers care less than we do.",
      "Is there a list of which streamers will be participating? ",
      "It really is unfortunate. I want to support the game and I really want to get a win under my belt.",
      "It's happening to me nearly every game. ",
      "Is anyone getting severe game breaking lag since the last patch? It seems to be happening to me during every game. At some point, my character just starts lagging and teleporting backward and I can't ever get out of it. I know it's not my internet because all other games are working properly. ",
      "I agree that this format is much better than live streams. Streams are always disappointing and take up way too much time. These high light reels are much better. ",
      "Is anyone having bad lag issues since Patch 2?  I'm having frequent lag or glitches that make the game unplayable. I can't really move. All other games are working fine.",
      "I agree. Waiting until half way through the day to dive into new activities and content completely kills the hype and excitement. One of the dumbest decisions that Bungie has made. ",
      "I'd like to see a Fallen civil war to be honest. Normal Fallen against the Splicers. This shouldn't be the center of an expansion but somewhat of a side story that we happen to find ourselves in. No declaring allegiance for us we just have to fight through some of it and witness its effects. Bungie clearly loves alien civil war plot lines so this would be second nature to them.",
      "I've been waiting for either Sony of Microsoft to start this practice at E3 some year. To make all show floor demos available on XBL or PSN all week. We live in a world where paid early access is a thing so I don't see why it isn't possible.",
      "Not sure what this means?",
      "So I got a leak that had all of the singles that Jack released mixed with instrumentals from some other band...it turns out those songs from the other band are really, really good. Any idea who theyre from?",
      "2700 tracksuit",
      "Jack mentioned Rage being one of the greatest of all time right before the Lazaretto single dropped. It's obvious they've been influencing much of his new material. He is essentially rapping on quite a bit of his newer stuff. ",
      "Not to mention Faction Rally is an extremely simple, mundane and uninspired idea to begin with.",
      "I've been thinking about how much of a failed feature this has been. They need to get over themselves and find some way to create Matchmaking or an in-game LFG system. If they are that scared about \"bad\" players ruining raid groups that are match made then they could go the attunement route and make everyone who have to accomplish certain tasks before using matchmaking.",
      "The change to Iron Banner is the first design decision that I've vehemently disagreed with. Iron Banner provided a nice change of pace and gameplay variety in Destiny. Now it's a Control play list where you can earn fancy armor. I get that they're trying to make content more accessible to the player base but this is one step too far. I get that they want more of the player base to experience more of their content. But moving Iron Banner to literally just be the same thing as normal Crucible doesn't mean that more players get to experience Iron Banner...it means Iron Banner isn't something special to experience anymore. It's the same thing as standard Crucible. I really hope Bungie changes their mind on this going forward.",
      "I really hope they port the old content over time. Leave it exactly as it was, just bring it over. ",
      "I suggested a zone similar to the dark zone in The Division that melds PvE and PvP.",
      "I thought for sure we would get a zone or destination like this. Why? Because The Division is the only game competing with Destiny and it's main hook is the dark zone. If Bungie could take that away from them, that's huge. It could be a zone you can enter with a fire team or solo and you'd have certain PvE objectives but all guardians would be able to compete and conflict with each other. Some may join forces and same may attack each other. There could be incentives for both. You could have conflicting objectives...one fire team hold down a building while another attacks and three nearby Fireteams have their own objective that may or may not drag them into the battle. A ton of stuff could be done. It plays right into Bungie's MO as well; Large multi-faction battles. You could put it together lore wise through the Crucible and Shaxx. His latest challenge and training for guardians. Bungie really should implement it at some point in D2's lifespan. Especially with the rapidly growing battle royale genre rising to prominence. They don't need to do something that grand, just something a little different that our standard arena now.",
      "I love the addition of Dead Sectors but yes I still wish there were grimoire cards and dead ghosts to collect.",
      "Even if it doesn't have the Destiny 2 branding?",
      "The point of Connington having it is that it gives him a looming sense of duty. He needs to see Aegon to the throne before he succumbs. Pending death is always said to motivate people to push themselves and go places they wouldn't normally dare. But in Jorah's case it doesn't really seem to have done much other than maybe remind him of his mortality.",
      "Speaking of marathoning and staying up...Has Bungie clarified whether Homecoming can be played in coop in the final game? Or will it be restricted like the beta?",
      "Has Bungie clarified whether or not you can play Homecoming with a Fireteam in the final game? Or will you be forced to go in solo like the beta?",
      "It seems like it wouldn't be too hard to implement and would be a nice change of pace. I'd also like yo see Bungie implement something similar to rifts in Diablo. Randomly generated instances with increasing degrees of difficulty. Each patch they can add a few new levels of difficulty. I would foresee solo and 3-player versions with high end rewards. Or even Seasonal rewards and Leaderboards like Diablo. It would be a nice end-game addition to accompany raids. ",
      "Isn't there a reference to a Kraken in the Arienne Winds preview chapter as well?",
      "Any idea what the items are yet?",
      "I actually have concerns about the Cabal being the main antagonist of D2. I certainly agree that they needed more focus, depth and exposure. And it looks like we're getting that. But they don't feel like much of a threat. I get that story wise they are. They took the Tower and control of the Traveller. But honestly, we've fought them before. I'm not intimidated by some new elite legion of Cabal. The Taken on the other hand were new and mysterious. They had that other worldly feel. It felt like they could really turn everything upside down and take over everything. The Cabal on the other hand...I don't know. I get it, they can blow up entire planet's and take our light, etc. I just don't know that they're worthy of being the main antagonist of a full fledged sequel. This story seems more fit for a Rise of Iron style expansion.",

      "My hope has ways been that Stannis become Lord Commander. Who better to rebuild the Night's Watch and restore order at the wall after the war than the iron willed Stannis Baratheon?

      "Coming in from Broome County, BY. Can't wait. This could very well be the first time Queens plays material from the new album.",
      "Could be the first time that they debut new material live. Got tickets. Can't wait. ",
      "I figured both the Taken and SIVA infused Fallen would be back in some capacity in D2. Even if it's just a fringe mission where we have to go deal with them or the occasional public event, whatever. Bungie designed them and I figured they wouldn't just throw them away. That said, I agree. I'd like to see the SIVA infused Fallen take a much more drastic direction in both visual and skill set.",
      "I believe you can stream Phantom Dust using Beam.",
      "But Destiny is not just a game. It's a universe, much in the way World of Warcraft is. D2 wouldn't exist had Bungie not needed to start fresh with a new engine and tools. We'd be getting expansions to Destiny for a long time.",
      "That's honestly fine with me. I could see the D1 content being added for free. Other content will be added via expansions that I'm happy to pay for.",
      "I am hopeful that additional locations will be added to D2 over time. I'd like to see the old content eventually ported over to D2 as well as one or two more new locations over D2's lifespan.",
      "Bought tickets to the Upstate Concert Hall show. Want to hang out before show time? ",
      "The reason that I believe this theory is simple; It's Bungie. The same developer who had us play as the Elites in Halo 2 after fighting them for the entirety of Halo: Combat Evolved. Bungie continued to display an affinity for alien politics and faction shifts within the Covenant while working on the Halo series.",
      "While playing the trial on EA Access, I thought a companion app would make perfect sense. Glad to see there is one. Thanks for the heads up.",

      "I generally think D&D do a good job with the show but they definitely don't understand the later books as much as they do the earlier books. And I think there's certain characters that they clearly don't understand. The Dorne arc has been a complete mess, for example. ",

      "We are very lucky when it comes to crime. We don't see a lot down here in Whitney Point. It's one of the perks of having such a tightly knit community. ",
      "I think they both have their strengths. I think I prefer the books a tad bit more because they more consistently execute exciting story arcs. The show has watered down or muddied some of the story arcs or character development but it's still an amazing show and one of my all time favorites. ",

      "No but I've been to Brockport. ",
      "For the last two summers the Village water supply has ran pretty low. We issued voluntary water conservation orders both summers. Had the issue got worse, we would have had to make it involuntary and ban certain things like washing cars, watering gardens, etc. Luckily for us however, relief came and water levels returned to relative normalcy. There are real effects of droughts and California has been feeling them for quite a while now. So far in Whitney Point, we've been fairly lucky. Here's hoping that it stays that way. ",
      "Correct. ",
      "I was never that great at DOTA so competitive wasn't my thing but Lich and Spirit Breaker were probably my favorite characters. ",

I work pretty closely with our residents and I'm happy to be on a first name basis with so many of them. I'm glad they know that myself and our Village staff are here if they need anything. ",
      "We've undergone quite a revitalization. Our Main Street businesses received very visible upgrades in the last few years. We also have a Dunkin Donuts now if that hadn't been built before you left.\n\nWe're working on several new projects that will create noticeable differences such as a new fire station, housing improvements and more. ",
      "Ithaca and Whitney Point are two very different places. Both of our jobs come with different and unique challenges. Svante is a cool guy and I enjoy reading about what he's doing and tweeting back and forth from time to time. While I'm always challenging myself and trying to build my own skills, I don't wish I was anyone other than myself. When I was younger and trying to establish myself I had a lot of self doubt but I'm very happy with who I am. Many of my hardships and failures taught me very valuable lessons and have given me perspective. ",
      "I did have an opponent and he was actually a friend and colleague of mine. We have a very good working relationship now, which I am thankful for. The margin was very small, which is typical in \"small town\" elections. You're literally asking your neighbors to vote for you and you're both asking the same people for their support. I won by 10 votes. I worked very hard during the \"campaign\" and knocked on nearly every door in the Village to speak with them to get their thoughts on the Village and what they think needs to happen. ",
      "There are certainly a lot of people who vote based on false information or factors that probably aren't good reasons for supporting or opposing a candidate. It definitely happens. We just have to hope that there are more people who are accurately informed when they go into the voting booth than not. The 2016 Presidential election was an election where that didn't hold true. I think a lot of people voted based on misconceptions and bad information.\n\nWhen it comes to a name that carries a legacy, such as a family name I certainly think that can impact an election. Names like Bush, Clinton, Roosevelt, Kennedy...Yes, that can certainly impact your chances one way or another. ",
      "I actually have a glass eye so if I get punched in the face, bad things will happen. I'm going to give him the edge for that reason. ",
      "I guess I wouldn't say that name DOESN'T affect elections but I don't think it's usually the dominant factor. Especially in local elections, I think people vote for who they know and who they support/oppose. That's always the hope anyway. You hope people make informed decisions based on best interests of the community, society, etc and don't just vote on something like a name or whim. ",

      "I played Lucio this week for the first time. I went 5-1 in my 6 games played as Lucio. The trick to playing him well is realizing that his healing isn't his strength. Speed boost is actually more essential to good support. Utilizing speed boost and amp at the right times helps your team chase down fleeing heroes, get your teammates to safety quicker, get to objectives in the moment, flank enemies quickly, etc.",
      "I played Fallout 3 and 4 and honestly I wasn't a huge fan of either. They feel kind of flat to me. I think the highlight of Fallout 3 for me was that mutant Faux. I finished the game before it was patched. I had him with me at the end. He was immune to radiation and could have just walked into that room at the end to get whatever was needed but instead the game forces you to do it so you die because it's your \"destiny.\" Not a lot of common sense there!",
      "It's a personal opinion that I don't find The Reef to be very interesting subject matter. It's always felt a little thin to me. Bungie may be able to prove me wrong by digging deep and doing some unexpected things but thus far the story around The Reef in Destiny hasn't been that exciting to me and that concerns me because I want the September expansion to make a splash and succeed. Not saying it can't. ",
      "I have never seen a game have so many event delays as Destiny 2 have and its really inexplicable. I really can't fathom it or recall a game that has more events get delayed or changed part way through because of game breaking bugs. Other games quickly hotfix their issues. The whole point of Destiny 2 being a new game was so that Bungie could roll out patches, fixes and content quicker. The exact opposite has occured which makes no sense to me as I know Bungie has a great day of talented people especially when it comes to art, audio and gameplay design. They must have massive flaws in their processes or procedures that they use or something. Its mind boggling to me.",

Someone stabbed someone in SHARPE, and it went through his body. That was on film as well! It was one of the early SHARPES, eagle or rifle, maybe, in Russia in the Crimea, and the sword actually went like that\n\n*gestures to midsection*\n\nHe was alright but it was a pretty shocking moment, because there were no hospitals around there, no ambulances, so if you got injured, it was pretty bad. But I've cut my hand open, you just kind of get on with the job, I split my knuckles open and got 5-6 stitches in them, on a set, and I went back and got back into the scene.

And I guess that's why you see him in various different roles, various times of his life, and he's been told that he's not who he thinks he is. It's a psychological thriller with action. It comes from the characters, it's not action for the sake of action, people find themselves in very desperate situations. It's a very fast moving thriller. ",
      "I suppose as Victoria said, someone's approached me in a pub and asked me if I'd come and live in their house. \n\nI said \"When?\" \n\nGlasses, wallet, chapstick, moneyclip.\n\nI'm not reading any books at the moment, which I don't know why, because I like reading books, but I'm probably going to go and buy one now. And me favourite book, it's an old book, called The World of Little Foxy, by Norman Smithson, and it's about this young lad, you know, young kid growing up in Yorkshire, all the fun and frolics he gets up to. Just a really nice, cheerful book. \n\n",
      "No, it's not something I'd winge about, I'm not complaining. I'm very fortunate in my career. The people that like my work and enjoy my work are the people who make me what I am, I suppose! ",
      "That would be nice. Yeah. But I'm not sure. I guess that will be the main role, wouldn't it? So I don't know. Good idea though.\n\nYES, many, many fond memories. And just fascinating, watching such an artist at work. He's a great man. ",
      "It's a fun show that will get you through the rest of the summer until Game of Thrones comes back. Also I don't die. ",
      "Neither!\n\nIt's pronounced \"Shawn Bean.\" ",
      "Oh that was one of the most exciting experiences of my life! It was a real, just, it was unbelievable. It was an incredibly fantastic just to be on the pitch wearing a Sheffield United kit, trying to score penalties! My grandad and my father were there, in the crowd, so I was kind of waving at them. Sheffield was playing Manchester United in the FA Cup, and we all went onto the pitch at halftime to kind of play a bit of foot and take some penalties, it was full of 45,000 people, and I think the teams were waiting to come on after the sendoff, and they couldn't get me off the pitch. I was so exhilarated. So we were holding back Sheffield United and Manchester United. The referee was getting a bit pissed off. I just didn't want to leave the pitch. The crowd was good, yeah! Especially from the Sheffield United Fans, and I am eternally grateful for that. And the Manchester United fans were a good lot, a good bunch. ",
      "Could be fun! ",
      "Did they just sort of walk in? It's 'cause they're so small.",
      "I guess the humor, the people, and the particular blend of humor more than anything. ",
      "I still play the piano a little bit, not very much, I wish I had kept it going you know? But it's just time I suppose. But perhaps I'll get some piano lessons when I get back to London and see if I can resurrect the little I did know, I'm not very good, but I do try. And I guess Chopin is my favourite, Chopin and J.S. Bach. ",
      "Yeah, that'd be good. That's be good fun. I've never ridden a dragon before! ",
      "As in kidney or runner!",
      "1) Neck of lamb, which has been kind of stewed for a few hours. That's what me mum used to make. It's *gorgeous*, very kind of tender and just melts in your mouth.\n\n2) Superhero, oh god... I was thinking Thor. \n",
      "I don't think I did. But I knew of it. ",
      "I guess Mark Addy, I see him on occasions. It's a funny job actually, because you're all thrown together for an intense period of time, and then everybody goes home, it's a strange business in that way. But we always bump into each other from various productions, on the same kind of circuit. ",
      "I guess that would be SHARPE, you know? The Napoleonic soldier. \n\nAnd thank you very much!",
      "I think it was all a dream. I didn't die? That's probably why I don't remember. ",
      "I've got a couple of swords, quite a few swords actually. One of my favorite ones is my SHARPE sword, which is an original cavalry sword from the late 19th century. ",
      "I can't remember any crashes, because we had ex-Grand Prix racers driving the cars and they were brilliant, some pretty hairy moments going down sidestreets with just an inch next to each side of the car, fast... Thrilling. ",
      "Baked beans. ",
      "Yes, that was great, a great experience working with the Wachowksis. Because they both direct together, you know? It's fascinating to see them work. It's just a wonderful world they've created, very surreal, magical sometimes, corrupt universe. It's very detailed. It's difficult as I've not seen the finished product yet, but it was a wonderful experience to work on! It comes out in February, I think. ",
      "Heinz baked beans. ",
      "It was a BBC drama called Joey and Spansky. I was about 23. Yeah. ",
      "What? ",
      "Cold. ",
      "I thought Heinz was an american company? ",
      "Yes, I saw it a few months ago. I guess Boromir kind of, was one of my favourites. And the least favourite? Any that were too quick!",
      "I filmed in the Crimea, which was in 1992, which at that time, I think, the Berlin wall was just coming down, so it was quite a turbulent time, so many good memories there, of all the cast and crew that I worked with. It was quite a wonderful experience. It was pretty basic, and you'd get home at night, and it was like staying in a sanitarium they'd converted into a hotel, you'd find a lot of cockroaches in your bath, yeah. And we'd get food parcels sent out, suitcases full of food, because the food was so... I don't know, just a load of slop, like dog meat, you know? So we'd send out for biscuits, these meals that kind of astronauts have in foil packets and we were surviving on that. It was really 'ard but really funny at the same time. I was there for 6 months every year for 3 years. I guess I lived there for 3 years. \n\nI sometimes see Daragh O'Malley and John Tams. I don't see them as often as I'd like to, but they're good pals. We went through a lot together. ",
      "Probably, yeah! Why not? ",
      "It was a bit strange, yeah, a bit creepy. We just kicked it around like a football!",
      "MMM.\n\nThat sounds nice. ",
      "I think villains are kind of the more juicy parts, you can kind of get way with murder (literally) but it's been fun playing Martin in LEGENDS because he's a bit of both really. He uses quite brutal methods to achieve his aims, but he's a good guy. ",
      "Occasionally we bump into each other, you know, doing our rounds. Yeah. I bump into Viggo occasionally, or Orlando Bloom. ",
      "Ali Larter smells nice. Like honey and flowers. ",
      "No, I did know I was going to get it, at the end. And I signed on anyway, because it was such a good part. ",
      "I talked to Howard, Howard Gordon, I guess it was through my agents, and they mentioned that Howard would like to talk to me about this project, and I said of course, knowing Howard and all the great work he's done, I was, you know, delighted to be asked to be part of it, because he explained the premise of it and all these  takes on multiple identities and it seemed a very fascinating idea. I was thrilled, you know, to play Martin Odum, and his various creations. ",
      "Yes, I think that was a possibility some years ago, but unfortunately it never came to fruition. But it would have been interesting, and very exciting. ",
      "If I played Dungeons & Dragons... I'd come up with my own, yeah. ",
      "I start from scratch, yes. I guess you draw upon life experiences, people or characters that you've met in the past, it comes from lots of different areas, but the idea is to draw upon endless ideas. I think there's a bit of everyone in everyone, you know? We all take things from other people, and they all kind of rub off on us. ",
      "Stay tuned!",
      "I guess they're different mediums, they both have their pros & cons, you know? But I would like to do more theater, it's just that sometimes it takes quite a while and it's very intense, but it's a big thrill, it's exciting doing live drama. And I did perform in Romeo & Juliet, I was Tybalt, but I didn't have any leather on. That was Hugh Quarshie. But it was a modern day production, yeah, and that was at the Royal Shakespeare Company back in 1985, 86, sometime around then. ",
      "Yeah!!"

It was one of the first sketches where we just kind of said, \"Alright, let's just do it.\" It wasn't about the lines so much as it was about literally making Jordan laugh, and then hearing him pepper these one liners back at me, which was really just very free pure joy.

So, you're taking kittens and gangsters and mixing them together. Or you're taking nerdy guys who have to pretend they're assassins, guys who've never handled a gun are pretending to be the two greatest assassins in the world. So, you just take opposites and you smash them together and you use juxtapositions to make people giggle. To make people say, \"Oh my god that's ridiculous, how's that happening?!\" So, if you're writing comedy, to think in that way is always helpful. \n",

      "The idea for recurring characters came from us. We like the challenge of trying to widen the world in which some of the characters live. The way we look at it, is as if you are seeing another scene in a movie about that character. As opposed to a sequel to the scene.",
      "The process varies depending on the scene. What you just wrote about us having certain experiences and extrapolating from there is one of our processes. But we also do sketches that our writers bring in cold. With no initial input from us.\n\nA typical day when were shooting is about 12-15 hours. we shoot about two scenes a day and watch edits of previous scenes that we shot and do casting for upcoming scenes. It's always a jam-packed day.\n\nI think (Keegan) that a degree has been exceedingly helpful for me in my career. I believe it goes both ways. There are some things, technique-wise, you learn in school that you wouldn't be able learn out in the world and vice-versa. Sometimes it comes down to efficiency. You might learn something in training in three months that it could take you three years to discover out in the field.",

And Key and Peele again is different in that it's not as character based as MADtv and SNL are. It's a really \"fluid\" journey, but an immensely enjoyable one.",
      "I don't know if it's a problem, but there are definitely lots of people who still don't know we have a television show and we are constantly trying to find ways to remedy that. ",
      "Key and Peele is the favorite right now, because we get so much freedom to do what we want to do. I had a lot of fun working on a sitcom called Gary Unmarried about three years ago. It was directed by James Burroughs, who was one of the creators of Cheers.",
      "They're kinda' are favorite! As we started devising the show we looked to a lot of British comedy. Fry and Laurie, Mitchell and Webb, Katherine Tate, Saunders and French. We love 'em.",

      "Yes we will if the racial aspect of the sketch is really stellar. the challenge is how to make a racial sketch funny without being overly didactic. We are trying to explore new ways of telling the Bi-racial joke, which in essence is a bi-cultural joke.",

      "I think it's a \"societal\" spoonful of sugar that helps the medicine go down. Sometimes the only way to disarm a situation in our world is to insert laughter. It also allows you to see an issue from a different angle.",

      "We have a couple of movies in development right now as a matter of fact. look out for them in a couple of years, it could take that long.",
      "We do get compared TO Chappelle's SHow occasionally. The format is familiar one that has been on shows like Laugh In, The Smothers Brothers and Sonny and Cher. We thought it was something about Sketch Comedy that isn't broken, so why change it. it works for the show and helps us set up the sketches. And helps you guys, to get to know us better.",
      "We know your pain and then we used it to our advantage ;) Our style of comedy,I would say is, just doing what we find funny and not concerning ourselves with trying for a tone per se. If you do what you want from your heart the style generates itself. ",
      "I think starting a stand up routine or getting involved with an Improvisation Training Center is the best way to go. So you can surround  your self with a community.",
      "Of Course. Hypothetically speaking.",
      "Lots of the ideas come from everyday observations and tropes we see in movies and the like. The primary motivation is always to make people laugh out loud in their homes. Everything else is second. Some things are a close second, but second nonetheless.",

      "Met at the Second City in Chicago and after 15 minutes we were two peas in a pod.",
      "We just think our ugly mugs dressed as women are funny. We haven't had any outside influences ask us to dress in drag. It's just an old time honored comedic tradition in my estimation. we thought it might help with the variety of the show.",
      "I believe so, i think we actually got picked up for our second season because of the online numbers. But it has been a challenge getting more people to tune in to the ol\" telly.",

Or Samuel and LaShawn, or I'm Retired or Zombie Attack, not Racist Zombie, or School Bully, or Roommate Meeting, or New Detective, Cat Poster, Michael Jackson Halloween, LA Vice, Cute Puppies, Insult Comic, High on Potenuse, Continental Breakfast, Tim Cook Meltdown, Exorcist, Post Apocalyptic Hunt, Dub Step, XBox Dance Game, There are some more.",

      "No, no, you got a rip up the slice into approximately twenty pieces then \"sprinkle: it on top of the salad.",
      " My favorites would be Cockney and East Indian, but I love West Indian dialects as well. ",
      "Yes, right around the corner from six to ten.",
      "Yes, but typically that happens when we're writing. We really scrutinize the sketches at that point. When we're shooting we are definitely comfortable with the pieces. Sometimes, though you edit a piece and it just doesnt come out right. so we jettison it.",
      "We can't on Key and Peele for legal reasons. Sorry.",
      "Big Fan of Lewis and Clark and Mitchell and Webb.and Martin and Lewis ( much younger Lewis)",
      "We love Vandaveon and Mike they have a life of their own and wish more folks knew about them and their relationship.",
      "I think I said Bitch. may be my favorite. Or any of the Valet Sketches.",
      "For me Keegan, it's always real life and what happens in this realm. Particular things though not general feelings. Particular observations will always be helpful. Always. Let the world around you be a Creative spark.",
      "My favorite moment at the Second City was the one time that I improvised a scene and it went straight into the show, the next day, with no revisions. It was a magical night. A magical moment.",

      "Usually the writers will assign the roles before hand if we didn't write the sketches. But we do some switcheroonies every now and then. ",
      "well we were teamed up together before Comedy Central actually. We wrote and Created the show for Comedy Central.",
      "I used to work at The Second City in both Detroit and Chicago and then on MadTv. All three of those experiences were amazing. Super creative and free. really set me up with skills to do the job i do now.",
      "I would rate it 150, as in miles per hour, man does that guy shoot fast! It was a blast.",
      "Yes, that is one way to put it. In my estimation, Both sketches are at their core about vanity and pride and how potent a phenomenon that is in our lives as humans",
      "We met in Chicago when Jordan was visiting to do a show. About 11-12 years ago.",
      "it depends on the sketch. some come out of a writer's mind fully cooked, some are written by committee, some take a week and some take two months. so many different paths.",
      "Jordan was on a cool pilot called The Station and I did a sitcom with Jay Mohr called \"Gary Unmarried.\"",
      "Probably the Valets. but we try to stay pretty focused, since, because of budgetary restraints, time is really of the essence when we're shootin.",

      "They are pretty prejudice against Freshman  winning and then went and gave it to a Freshman. Go figure.",
      "I would say we definitely do care. The challenge is making a scene that makes sense Comedically, if it comes off too mean or not realistic enough, of just insensitive for no good reason. We won't do it.",

      "You know, it's funny. We definitely did not do it intentionally. \n\nWe wrote the script, maybe three years ago, and in all seriousness, when *John Wick* came out, I thought there had been some kind of leak. I called my manager and was like, \"What's going on here? Somebody got word here of our script and they even cast Keanu in this movie *John Wick*,” and this and that. And it turned out to be a complete coincidence. It sounds like B.S., but it really is not. We'd probably be smarter to claim that it is a parody because people seem like to like it, but I cannot tell a lie. It is a completely independent idea.",

      "We're doing good! We're very excited to see what happens with Keanu, April 29th. It was just such a joy to be able to shoot a movie, and a movie with this cast. I think it could be a movie that could be a phenomenon that goes on for a long time. I think people will watch it and rewatch it and rewatch it again, so...we're doing good!",

      "Yeah, I mean we were very nervous going into it because we were such big fans of the film, and it's kind of like, why would we be in this? Why would you put Key and Peele in this? Would we not be distracting? And when we got there, Noah Hawley - the guy who created the show and is the showrunner - he's such a genius. He has a real patience and poise to him. I think we kind of figured it out as we were there. Now as far as stories go, we were in Calgary, and it was freezing.",

      "I'm a huge nerd. I played many role-playing games growing up. Dungeons & Dragons, Gurps, Rifts, the Paladin games. The one game I never played growing up was bitches. Bitches and role-playing games usually don't go together very well. \n\nThe first sketch I wrote was when I was a kid and I must have been ten years old and my white friend and I did a little video where he was playing piano and he wished he could be a better piano player and then the wish came true. I replaced him and because I was black, I was a better piano player. That's *Key & Peele* 101. OG shit. ",

I remember that day, having to do it enough times and it was so physical, and just screaming the entire time that I shed about twenty pounds and was just dripping sweat. And I almost died. \n\nSo yeah, it was hard.",

      "First, with *Red Eye*, that specifically wasn’t an influence, but *Scream* was and *The People Under the Stairs* was. As for whether or not Chelsea’s voice snuck into the script at all, I wrote it before I met my wife. But, there were elements of the character, Rose, that I did pull from Chelsea’s innate coolness and really found that the sense of humor at the center of the love story was the most important thing.",

So, we basically created what was to us the perfect Key & Peele movie and we wrote the whole thing, the first draft, without a kitten in it. And then we realized we needed something to bring us in and bring the heart to the movie, so we came up with this idea of this kitten that wears a do-rag and we put it on the poster and everybody who doesn't know Key & Peele would hopefully have to go see the kitten do-rag movie. Besides that, any movie that we've ever really laughed at is a movie that we've cared about the characters. So, Keanu is a way for the audience to reaaally, reaaally root for our character through the whole arc.",
      "Which is good. That's actually not bad. That's the top tier of what I'm puttin' down. Then there's *Family Therapy with Dr. Jen*. Abysmal programming. Like a fine wine that's been fermenting in it's own...uffff...",

Yeah, there were some sketches that were deemed too specific. I will say that the Gremlins 2 sketch was a sketch that got put on hold for the longest time and I didn't think we were ever going to do it because it was so highly referential and finally in the last season I made them do it.",
      " My original expectation for “Get Out” was that there was no way going to get made. Still, I wanted to make a movie that addressed the fact that we are not in a post-racial world.  Now, I think it’s quite clear to everybody; no one has any mistake as to whether or not race in a problem in our society and culture. So, I feel like fate has brought this movie to a point where it’s even more needed and more interesting than what I originally intended it to be.",

It's made me feel less lonely,\" or, \"It's made me feel like I have something to identify with.\" That was rewarding. And then here, saying that we can bring some awareness to the plight of animals and hopefully having people adopt them. That's rewarding in a different way.",

I was lucky enough to have worked the last few years with Peter Atencio, who really shared a vision, but this was a very welcome departure, as well because it was fun.\n\nI would say, first off, write your favorite movie that you haven't seen. Don't worry about whether it's going to get made. Write something for yourself. After you have that draft then worry about what you need to do to sell it. I would also say, as a director, enjoy yourself. It's such a stressful job and if you take the time to take a breathe and have quiet moments for yourself to just say how the fuck did I get here? This is awesome. That will seep into the work and people will feel it. People will feel the joy. ",

That's something that's very fulfilling. Then here, it's the same thing with the cat. So, I'd say that it's apples and oranges. It's equally as rewarding. ",

      "Don't take any advice from me.\n\n",
      "Oh no! Um... hahaha... well, *this* is certainly not my element. I like being outside, sometimes? I don't really have one element. I tend to adapt. I like to work. I'm not one of those actors who... you know, has to do a play every year. So I wouldn't say the stage is necessarily my element. \n\nYeah, I like being outside, haha!",
      "So... I always wanted to be an actor, but I'd like to go back to the fire department question, because the person mentioned my connection to the fire department, and I do support this wonderful group in New York called [\"Friends of Fire Fighters.\"](http://www.friendsoffirefighters.org/) And it was started by Nancy Carbone, in the aftermath of 9/11, she just went around to the firehouses in her community, to see if they needed anything, and it's grown into this amazing organization, where they provide mental health services to firefighters and their families, as well as other services, and I can't say enough good things about them. They were there for the firefighting community after 9/11, and after Hurricane Sandy, but they are there on a daily basis, for any firefighter or their family that needs support or help.\n\nAnd getting back to the acting question - it's something I thought about as a kid. I never really thought I'd do it for real, or certainly make a living at it, and it's something that - it took years to sort've... be able to make a living at it, and I feel lucky that I'm able to. ",
      "Well, John Oliver's show is really, really good.\n\nAnd I like the Daily Show. And I think Larry Wilmore is doing a great job on his show. I'll be very sorry to see Jon Stewart go. I think he's just been amazing every year that he's been on. \n\n*What do I like?...* Well, BREAKING BAD. I guess that's not current, but that's something I really like... what's on now? Game of Thrones, that's a good show... and I love watching Peter Dinklage. You know, I've worked with Peter a lot over the years. Our first movie that we did was called LIVING IN OBLIVION, that was written & directed by Tom DeCillo, and it was about the making of a low-budget movie, and Catherine Keener's in it, and Dermott Mulroney, and he's made some really wonderful films. I've worked with him a few times. The last film that I did together with Tom (the director) was called DELIRIOUS, with Michael Pitt, and in that one I play a paparazzi-type photographer, and Michael played a homeless/out of work actor, but I take him under my wing and he becomes famous and gets his own reality show. And it's a very funny film. In LIVING IN OBLIVION, Peter played a character in a  dream sequence that I did. ",
      "I know that people love that film. It's always hard to relate funny stories. But I'm so happy that that is a film that has gotten a lot of attention over the years. Because when it first came out, I think it was - not that it wasn't received well, but I think that initially, people (or critics anyway) were mystified by it. This was coming after FARGO. That, you know, FARGO was their first film that really broke into the mainstream. Probably any other filmmakers would have followed that film with something as equally as commercial, and they decided to go with THE BIG LEBOWSKI. And I think it took years for that film to develop a following. I think it took a good 5 years before people would stop me on the street, and talk to me about it. But then it was like - mostly college kids, who had seen it, at that time, you know, 5 times, or 6 times, and then the following time people would tell me that they'd seen it 10 times, and it's just grown over the years into Lebowski-fest. So it's so satisfying to see a film like that get made to begin with, and then turn into a classic that people enjoy seeing over and over again. ",

      "Well, uh, for all the DEEDS fans out there... french fries and oreos, definitely. ",
      "Well - maybe people will realize by now that i don't feel very comfortable doing these things, so I guess I don't put a lot of thought into - to be honest, I'd rather not be answering any questions. I guess if I *HAD* to think of a question - um... \n\nYou can put \"long pause here\" -\n\nI don't really have one. ",

      "Um... well, I'm kinda curious what happened to Garland Greene? I guess if he got on another plane, haha, that could be a CON AIR 2. Sure! I had a lot of fun making that film. And I thought it was a great cast, and I thought Jerry Bruckheimer and Simon West put together a really great cast, and it was fun to hang out in the desert with all of them. So yeah!",
      "That was a film I did with Adam Sandler, years ago, and um, my character likes his pizza with a lot of different toppings on it. ",
      "I don't think you can point to any one character and say that that's \"me\" but... with any role I play, I only have myself, to put myself into it, so there will be aspects of my personality that will come through, or I guess, exaggerations of my personality. And sometimes that's fun to do - like in a character like Mr. Pink, where i would NOT want to be that person in real life, but it was certainly fun to... explore aspects of my personality. Where I could be that person. And then, you know, there's roles like - there's a character I played in this movie, IN THE SOUP, which was an independent film I did in the early 90's with the writer / director Alexander Rockwell - and that's with Seymour Cassel and Jennifer Beals - and yes, there's aspects of that character that I think are like me... and certainly the character that i wrote for myself in TREES LOUNGE would be an exaggerated version of myself. The idea for that film came to me when I thought *what would I be doing if I never left my hometown? If I never went into acting? If I never pursued the things that I did? and was still doing the things in my home town that i was doing when I was young, what might I have become?*\n\nSo I guess you could say there's a lot of me in that character, as well.

And then a movie that I've always loved but I hadn't seen it in years because I'd watched it so many times that i didn't know if i could watch it any more is IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. Also... let me see... FAT CITY, with Jeff Bridges and Susan Tyrell... any John Cassavettes film... ",
      "Just his enthusiasm, you know?\n\nHe was SO excited to be making a film. And... to be directing his first film. In rehearsals, the rehearsals were just as exciting as the filmmaking! He would set up - this whole improvisation of us robbing the jewelry store, so that we would improvise and act out what went wrong. He just had, you know, has a lot of joy, in him! And it was - it made all of us also feel like we were working on our first film. ",

      "Well, they were all memorable moments.\n\nAnytime you're on a Coen brothers set, it's just the most fun and relaxed set.\n\nI just loved doing those long takes with John Goodman and Jeff Bridges. And I love sitting between them, you know? There's that one scene where we're at the counter in the bowling alley, and I'm seated between them, and they're arguing - and I LOVED just being around those guys.\n\nI was once in a hotel room, and through the wall, I could hear this loud voice on the phone.\n\nAnd at first I thought *Oh my god, I have this really loud neighbor. Maybe I should switch rooms!* And then I recognized the voice, and it was John Goodman. So I actually heard him ordering room service, hahaha, loudly! And so when the room service tray came up, I popped my head out the door, and he was very surprised to see me. And he said \"Forget room service! Let's go down and have dinner!\"\n\nAnd I just love being around him.\n\nAnd of course, Jeff Bridges is one of the sweetest guys. He's a really great photographer. He would take pictures of us on-set. And he's been in like, all these great movies, and it was just fun to hear him tell us stories of what it was like to work with John Huston on the set of FAT CITY...\n\nJeff Bridges could bring about world peace. \n",
      "Superman. \n\nThat was one of the shows I loved as a kid, too. Although I loved the Batman series as well. But Superman is definitely the one I remember first. There was NOTHING like the excitement of that show coming on TV, when I was a kid. And I did have a Superman outfit - a costume that I got for - I believe my 5th birthday. And on the cape, of the costume, it was printed - I forget how it was worded, let me see - it was something like \"You cannot really fly while wearing this outfit.\" \n\nBut then it said \"Only the **REAL** Superman can fly.\"\n\nI swear to you. That's what it said. \n\n**Only the REAL Superman can fly.**\n\nI really did believe in Superman.",
      "Well, I signed up for 2 seasons, so I fully expected to come back for another season - and towards, you know, towards the end of that season, it was season 5, I got a message on my phone from David Chase, and the joke on-set was \"You never want to get a phone call from David Chase.\" And...so... I called him back, and he asked me if I wanted to have lunch the following day, I said sure, he picked a restaurant, and I got off the phone and thought *Maybe this is a good thing, maybe there's something else he has me in mind for, it doesn't necessarily mean that my character was going to get wacked.*\n\nSo I met him for lunch, I was thinking about it, didn't sleep much, and I got to the lunch and the first thing he said was:\n\n\"I'm sorry. We're going to have to kill you.\"\n\nSomething like that. I don't remember his exact words, but it was to the effect that there was just no way that my character could conceivably live doing what he did. \n\nAnd of course, I understood! *chuckles*\n\nBut I was sad that i wasn't coming back, because it was such a wonderful show to work on. ",
      "As far as roles go, I don't tend to hold onto that stuff. If I passed on anything, I think it was for the right reason.\n\nTop 3 favorite books... yeah, you know, there's this book called YOU CAN'T WIN by Jack Black (but it's not the Jack Black that we know of today - this was a guy at the turn of the century, who used to ride the rails, and led the Hobo life, and wrote about it as a cautionary tale - he drank too much, he did too many drugs - but it's hard not to read that book and not want to live the life that he led! It's a book that really inspired William Burroughs, and actually, he had two books I really love - he's got a lot of books - but I really loved his books JUNKIE and QUEER).\n\nJUNKIE really describes the life that William S. Burroughs lived in New York - his life of, I guess he was writing about the 1940's, and then QUEER is when he lived in Mexico City, and Jack Kerouac's ON THE ROAD has always been a favorite too. ",
      "*chuckles*\n\nUm, well, thank you for that.\n\nAnd I like cheesecake. ",
      "Um... yeah, I mean, I was recognized, but nobody made a big deal out of it.\n\nAnd I was down there with the company that i used to work with, Engine 55. I used to work with them, you know, on the fire department in the early 80's, and they lost 5 members of their company, and so, you know, it was just... something that I wanted to do for them. To help them out? And being at the site... with them... with my old company, it really helped me out, you know. They're the ones that were helping me, because every New Yorker at that time, it was just a atraumatic thing to go through - and not just for New Yorkers, but the whole country was in shock. So I feel privileged to have been able to be there, on the site, because everyone I knew wanted to do something, wanted to help, but a lot of people just didn't know *how*, how to help immediately. And I did have a physical way of helping. But that did a lot for my state-of-being, and I was only down there for a few days, and I can't even describe - really- what it was like. But, um... I'm grateful that I was able to be there. ",
      "I did not (unfortunately) spend plenty of time with the kids in the film. But I do hope to meet them. Right now, the film is still being worked on, and that's why I'm doing this campaign. But I will say about these kids, you know, that I've seen in the documentary - they have tremendous heart, and tremendous courage, and I think they're certainly - they have a rough go of it, you know. Every day. And I find their struggle really moving, and inspiring. \n\nWell, you know, when I was their age, and growing up in the town that i grew up in, in the time that i grew up in, it was...it was... if you were gay, you could not let anybody know that. So to see these kids just really be who they are, and a lot of them are flamboyantly so, it kind of amazes me that there's - even in this day and age, that I think is a lot more tolerant than when I grew up - there's still a lot of hate out there, and especially where they live, it's really dangerous. It's quite dangerous for them to be who they are. And so they've banded together out of necessity- a lot of them come from broken homes - so they've created their own family with each other, so they really help and support each other, and I really admire that.\n\nI really...uh, admire that they struggle every day to make a life for themselves. ",
      "Well, I'm very partial to BILLY MADISON, because that was one of the first films that Adam did on his own, as part of his production company. And the film that we did before that was called AIRHEADS, which was directed by Michael Lehman, and that was the film Adam and I met on, where we played brothers in the band, \"The Lone Rangers\"... and I always have a great time working with Adam. I loved the character I played in THE WEDDING SINGER. I just worked with  him again on the western that he's shooting now called THE RIDICULOUS SIX. But yeah, I would say... I don't know if I have a favorite, but I really do love the character in BILLY MADISON. ",
      "Um... I guess either a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, or Almond Joy. ",
      "I love you too!\n\nAnd I don't know, if there is...*chuckles* a definite answer.\n\nI love that it's open to interpretation. She gets on that bus, and... I hope that she's going somewhere good. And I loved working on that film. Thora Birch was incredible to work with, and Scarlett Johannson, and Terry Zwigoff, they were really smart and very funny, and paid attention to every detail. The director would get obsessed with people in the background. Sometimes, after Thora and I would finish a scene, we would see Terry walk up to us, and we would think he was going to say something to us, but he would walk right by us and give very specific directions to the background actors, telling them \"Okay, let's do this again!\"",
      "You know, I have to be honest. It's these questions that make me nervous. I don't know why! I think it's a very personal thing to ask!\n\nYou can say that: I'm kidding.\n\nBut yeah, I don't know why these questions make me nervous. Hahaha! But they do!",

      "Um... I love Elvis Costello, and I think one album that i go back to of his is \"Get Happy.\" But he's done a lot of amazing work over the years. Same thing with Tom Waits. You know... \"Mule Variations\" is an incredible album, as is all of his work. I'll always go back to \"Abbey Road,\" even though I haven't listened to it fully in years. ",
      "You know, I really would go back to the 40's. I'm not saying it was because of BOARDWALK EMPIRE, but I always used to dream about, you know, being on the set of a Buster Keaton film. I think that would've been really, really cool. ",
      "*Hmmm.*\n\nI guess I don't read enough philosophy to answer that question. ",

      "Um... twenty-three. ",
      "Yeah, TREES LOUNGE was something that - took everything out of me! I so wanted to write something, and direct something, and write something that I could be in... but I never necessarily saw myself as a writer or a director. I had been doing work with a good friend of mine, the actor Mark Boon, Jr. - he plays the character of Bobby on SONS OF ANARCHY - and we used to do a lot of theater together, throughout the 1980's on the Lower East Side and in the East Village - and so we always created our own work, and that's what i was trying to do with the film, too. You know. To write a part for myself, for Boon, for my brother Michael who's a wonderful actor, and for friends of mine, like Rockets Redglare, who's a wonderful comedian and actor... So... I've continued to direct sometimes, and sometimes I have a hand in some of the things I've directed in, in the writing, but yeah! Maybe in the future. ",
      "*To keep myself calm, hmmm.*\n\nThere's different songs that would pop into my head. It depends what I'm listening to.\n\nRight now, Diana Krall has a new album out that I like a lot, so there's songs on there I've been humming in my head. She does some really wonderful interpretations of songs that I knew from years ago. One of them is ALONE AGAIN, NATURALLY. \n\nOr the Jim Croce song OPERATOR. ",
      "I was happy with the way it ended. No, I didn't necessarily see it coming, but I was glad that they wrapped it up on that story between Nucky and Gretchen Mol's character, because that was a story that always interested me, and you know, when you look through the series, Nucky and Gillian didn't really have a lot of scenes - I think I only had about 5 scenes with Gillian. And I always LOVED working with Gretchen, and I always wished we could do more together. But ever since that scene we did together at the fortune teller's shop, I always wondered - what was their relationship?\n\nSo sometimes the show writers were forthcoming with the backstory - and then sometimes they were not. So there was only *so much* that they could tell me about the backstory of Nucky. Because I think - especially when you're writing on a TV series - you don't know the complete story of your characters, and you're going to leave it open, so they can go in any direction that they want. So you don't get tied into a concrete backstory - so it wasn't until the final season, until those last few episodes, that I truly understood Nucky's backstory. ",
      "Well, I had a lot.\n\nI loved the 3 Stooges, the Little Rascals, The TWILIGHT ZONE, the Honeymooners, you know, and then things like Gilligan's Island... yeah, I would say those, yeah. ",
      "The weirdest one? Um... I dunno. Sometimes people will say \"Bushoomi\" or if they pronounce the C as a hard C - I guess it's hard to describe in print - like \"Booo-stemmi.\" ",

      "Well, you know, a few years ago, my good friend Stanley Tucci and I decided to start a production company, and we found a wonderful producer in Wren Arthur. She used to produce with Robert Altman. And so the 3 of us started this company, so that Stanley and I can direct films, but we also decided that we should develop other things, TV shows and such, and... we also decided that it would be good to maybe look into the documentary film world. We did make a documentary, called A GOOD JOB: STORIES OF THE FDNY, for HBO, that Liz Garbus directed... and then the filmmakers Dana Flor and Toby Oppenheimer, I'm not quite sure how they knew Wren, but they told her they had been shooting in DC, this gang of kids that they thought were pretty incredible, and they showed us some of the raw footage, and Wren and I were really excited by what we saw, and we thought it was an important story to tell, so we wanted to give them as much support as we could, so we are co-producers. ",
      "Well... where would I go? I don't know. I don't think about traveling that much. One of the most beautiful places that I've been to, though, was Sicily, and I'd like to get back there someday. \n\n*Where would I go?* Maybe South America. I've never been there. ",

      "Oh, I would say chocolate. ",
      "I don't, hahaha! None that are interesting, anyway. ",
      "Well, I can tell you the one that I probably had the most fun *making* was Stanley Tucci's film THE IMPOSTERS. This was the movie he made after BIG NIGHT, and we were all on a ship, and I played a character named Happy Franks, who was a sort of a suicidal lounge-singer... and it had an amazing cast of Stanley, and Oliver Platt, and Libby Taylor, and Elizabeth Brocco, Alison Janney, Tony Shahloub - we had SO MUCH FUN making it, and it's a very funny film as well. Billy Connolly is in it as well. "

      "Well, that's certainly true. This industry is tough on relationships. I've always thought that my wife should have a credit up alongside mine, because I couldn't do what I do without her support. And like the questioner asked, or said, we've been married since 1977, we knew each other for 2 years before that, so she's been able to do all these films with me and we've managed to get through them all together. The toughest thing about making movies is being apart from your family. One of the things I try my best to do is call my wife every day, to keep up to speed with what's going on in her life. And tell her what's going on with mine. Often when you're apart from your loved one like that for so long, your connection kind of atrophies unless you keep engaged, even if it's small everyday kind of stuff. But another aspect of keeping a marriage together, I think it's important to - you'll think I'm silly - but to love each other, which begs the question: \"what is love?\" Words that come to mind are openness, understanding, gentleness, kindness, and kind of working on those things, because everyone has a light and a dark side, I think, selfish aspects, and to kind of recognize those in each other and realize that we are going to have our own particular story at any given time, and those stories, they might not be the ultimate truth but they are certainly true for each of us, so to understand that we are each going through our particular version of reality, to respect that, and to nurture being in love, you know? To nurture that. ",

      "I didn't draw from John Wayne's movie. I remember when the Coen brothers first asked me if I wanted to make this movie, I was surprised because I thought John Wayne did a very successful movie, and I said \"Why do you want to do it again?\" and they said \"Have you read the book?\" and I had not, so after I did read the book I understood why they wanted to make the movie again. It read like a Coen brothers movie. So I jumped onboard, and I didn't really reference the John Wayne performance, it was mainly taking my cues from the character in the book. ",
      "Oh man, that's a tough one! Because each scene is so good, you know? The Coen brothers wrote such a brilliant script - I don't watch many of my movies on TV, but whenever I'm flipping the channels, and I'm a big flipper when I watch TV, when Lebowski comes up, I think \"Oh I'll just watch a few scenes\" and then I get sucked in, because the scenes are so funny. I particularly like that scene where I'm in the car with the Big Lebowski and he hands me that toe. ",
      "Is lox & bagels a sandwich? I like lox & bagels, I like kind of building that, the ritual of getting your bagel, I like my bagels toasted, almost burned, and then you put a medium spread of cream cheese, and then I like onions quite a bit, so I will put quite a few onions on it. I'm not really into tomato, but once in a while I will surprise myself with tomatoes. And then I'll put the lox on there, and then put some peppers, and then I will cut it in half and go to town. That's the first thing that popped into my head when you said sandwich, but it's hard to beat a good cheeseburger. As I'm thinking about it, and then the eastern thing is cool too, falafels and pita pockets, those are awful great too. I like sandwiches, now I'm thinking about all kinds of sandwiches. ",

      "That was SO much fun. Terry is such a great leader - just absolutely brilliant, but he has a childlike excitement that is contagious and spreads through the company, everybody has a lot of fun on a Terry movie. As far as Robin, originally I was a little anxious working with him because he's such an amazing comedian and I thought \"Oh god, when I work with him he will be cracking jokes and I have some serious scenes with him, how is this going to work?\" \n\nI remember one particular scene where Robin was in a coma, unconscious, and I had a long monologue, and I thought \"oh god, this guy is going to making jokes and stuff in the middle of this thing, winking at me trying to make me laugh\" but when we got to that scene, he was so there for me in a completely silent way, that I could feel his support in the silence, there was no winking or cracking jokes, and I finally came to learn that Robin is a very serious, accomplished actor, and comedy is just one of the tricks in his trick bag. He is an all-time master entertainer and actor. And Terry, I can remember working late nights with Terry and Robin, until 4 o clock in the morning, we would work 16 hours, and Robin would start to go around the crew & cast and just riff on everybody, he would go on and on making us laugh with his improvisation. Most directors would look at their watch and say \"Ok Robin time to go back to work\" but Terry would do JUST the opposite. He would encourage Robin, he would say \"Go! What about him? Or him?\" so he would go on for 10, 15 minutes. And after that comedic break, everybody's batteries would be recharged, and we would be good for another couple hours. ",
      "Wow. I remember my kids being born. And that was such an amazing, amazing moment in anybody's life, if you're lucky enough to be in the same room as what was happening. I didn't know that the eyes were capable of ejaculating tears but mine did when my kids were born. Well, maybe... gosh. This is a good question, but I'm here at the place now where I'm supposed to go. Let me think for a second here. \n\nI had a memory recently that I would like to share with everyone. I was visiting a school in Montana, and I was there on behalf of the No Kid Hungry program, and I was there to share a breakfast meal prepared for the students there and this was to support the breakfast after the ball program - this is to get rid of the stigma of the poor kid who has to come to school early and eat in the cafeteria. So at this school, you saw all these beautiful happy faces of kids eating together, the teachers were all so into it, you could see they were all well-fed and ready for a day of learning, and the joy on their faces, I would like to share that with everyone and to encourage you to make sure that the kids around us are taken care of,  because kids are our future.

      "Well, you know, certainly those 2 movies qualify for the home movie aspect of watching those movies for me. Where I remember all the good times I had when I was making them, what I had for lunch, what I did after work, those sorts of things. And so the first TRON, I really have fun memories from it, it was such an innovative movie at the time, it was shot in 70 MM black & white, and then  hand-tinted by a bunch of ladies in Korea, the whole thing, to create that world. It was very innovative. And then the other movie was fascinating too, it felt like a lot of it I was actually in the TRON world for real. I think I was one of the first actors to have my whole body scanned, so they could make me look young, they actually, you know, put my body into a computer, I remember having that process done and it felt like I was living the TRON world for real.\n\nAnd good. Well, I'm glad that you had a good experience with the first TRON and I hope you and your dad dug the second!",
      "That is true! And the costumer for The Big Lebwoski (and also True Grit and many of the Coen brothers films) came over to my house, and went through my closet, and there are quite a few articles of clothing that they used for The Dude from my closet. The baseball shirt with the famous Japanese baseball player on it I stole from my brother Beau, that is in the movie. And there might be some other ones, but nothing is coming to mind, I would have to look at the movie and see. ",
      "I always like to drink my White Russians with a little straw!",
      "1) Well, that's an interesting question. When the Coen brothers first came to me and said that they had written a script for me, I was really, you know, thrilled because I loved their other movies. But when I got the script, and I read the script, I enjoyed it, and I couldn't figure out where they got - they said they wrote it specifically *for me*, but there were no movies I had ever done that were anything like that, I thought they had maybe, you know, met me at a party in my early 20s or where had they gotten that character from. But I know a part of the character was based on a fellow named Jeff Dowd, and you know, I worked on the Dude the way I worked on most characters, where you read the script & it starts to tell you a lot about the way a character is, and the Coen brothers being such masters, you can get so much just by reading the script. And then I also looked into aspects of myself that might apply to the character, and I might magnify those, and aspects of myself that don't apply, I kick those to the curb. And of course, I always keep my mind open to any other Dude-like characters that might cross my path that I might incorporate into the character.\n\n2) I like *\"That's just your opinion, man.\"* That's one of my favorites. And my friend, Bernie Glassman, several years ago - and my friend is a zen master - told me that in buddhist circles, the Dude is considered a zen master. And  I said \"What are you talking about?\" and he said \"Oh yeah, the Big Lebowski is filled with koans.\" Koans are zen questions that you can't just answer intellectually, you have to kind of experience them. And I said \"What do you mean\" And he said \"Who made the movie? The KOAN brothers.\" And then he went on to say all these different lines like \"The Dude abides\" or \"Shut the fuck up, Donny\" - like taking ancient koans and bringing them into modern times. So Bernie said \"Why don't we write a book about it\" And we did. So we wrote a book together called [\"The Dude and the Zen Master.\"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Dude-Master-Jeff-Bridges/dp/0593072340) And Bernie's organization is called http://zenpeacemakers.org/",

      "Well, that kind of depends on the mood I'm in, you know? Right now as we talk, I think if somebody offered me that, and I had some bread, or some celery, I could do a peanut butter sandwich crunchy or smooth, I think I would go with crunchy peanut butter with the celery. Right now I'm kind of in the mood for celery and some crunchy peanut butter. But next time I might go with the smooth, you know? ",
      "You know, it changes from time to time. I am headed out to Comic-Con right now, so tomorrow when I get there, I think it will be a good dozen people. It changes from day to day. When I'm at home with my wife, it may never happen. ",
      "Oh, it was terrific. We've known each other for years. Our kids used to play soccer together. Yes! We met briefly during those times. And I admired her, as most people have, for so long, and was eager to work with her, and was so happy that she was onboard for the Giver because she's just a really remarkable actress. She brought a realism to this whole fictitious world. And I was just amazed by her freshness - it's like, she's been doing this so well for so long, one might think she would get complacent, but she really cared so much about the movie, and was so engaged and that kind of enthusiasm is contagious, and it spreads throughout the company, and whenever she was on the set, everybody upped their game and rose to the occasion. It was great to be able to do it with joy, you know? You could sense the love of her craft, you know, her art. ",
      "Oh yeah. Yeah. We were so fortunate to have Robert and that team, and also Jon Favreau, both those guys are incredible actors and improvisers. And that movie was so much fun to make. It was unusual because it was very expensive, close to $200 million or something, and you would think that a movie that had that high a budget, they would have had their script tighter. But that was not the case. And we would very often find ourselves, at the beginning of the day, going into our trailers with little tape recorders with the suits from Marvel & Jon & Robert, and we would try to come up with what we were going to shoot that day! We would trade parts, I would play his part, or he would play my part, Favreau would be calling up writer friends of his, and meanwhile the crew is tapping their foot, waiting for us to come back to work. That was very frustrating for me, because I like to be very prepared and let it go in front of the camera, so that you know your lines and stuff, and it was very frustrating for me, until I made a small inner adjustment that was: realizing we were making a $200 million dollar student film. And just to relax and have fun, do your best, don't worry too much, and I think that the film came out terrifically! And again, that's largely because we had Robert and Jon onboard. ",
      "Be love. That came to mind. It came from a wonderful dear friend and teacher of mine, a guy named Rozell Sykes, and he had a wonderful compound called St. Elmo's Village, I believe it's still there, right off La Brea off the freeway in Los Angeles, and he was a painter, and he would encourage me - this was back in the 1960's - he would encourage me to play my guitar while he painted, and I finally visited his compound, and I saw that it was almost like an art piece in itself, there were several bungalows, some of which he rented, and he painted EVERY surface. He loved every aspect of his life, you know? And encouraged us all to be love, to be the spirit of love, to be open and kind. Like what all the guys say, from Christ to the Dalai Lama. I saw the Dalai Lama once in Santa Barbara, and he was saying \"All religions are good\" - I'm going to misquote him here, but the gist of it was \"All religions are good, Christians or Buddhism or Judaism -- but be kind, be kind, that is my religion.\" I think that's another version of be love, not only to other people, but to yourself. \n\nSo this cuts down to just: be love. You can paraphrase the Dalai Lama. ",
      "Another comedy? Well, the comedic aspects are in most movies I do, I think. I did R.I.P.D. which came out not too long ago, and that was a comedy. I think they really screwed up the editing of the movie, we had a wonderful time making it, with Ryan Reynolds. Wonderful time working with the director. But the suits just cut it against the grain, and I thought, screwed it up. But it's got some funny parts in it. ",
      "Haha!\n\nWell, the first question was - it was wonderful to shoot in South Africa. We took advantage of a great natural phenomenon that is there, called Table Mountain in South Africa. And the crew was so professional there, the cast & the crew that was from that area, also my family visited for a couple of weeks, and we went on safari, and that was a really great experience. \n\nAnd that is NOT true - however, our young director who was the creator of TRON and it was his first movie when he made it - Stephen lined the walls of our sound stage, where we shot the movie, with video games! And you didn't need quarters! And I would often get locked into one of those games, and they would try to pry me off of it, and I would be saying \"You have to let me finish this game!\" The game I was really into at the time was a game called Battlezone, it looked very much like the Tron world he had created. A side point that I think is kind of interesting: the movie that I met my wife was a movie called Rancho Deluxe, and I played a whole scene with Harry Dean Stanton on Pong - remember Pong? It was probably the first video game. And the whole scene was played in our faces, in reflections of the Pong screen.  ",
      "Well, I often use my father in my acting quite a bit. I kind of conjure him up and invite him to come into my being, and so I'm sure he was with me a bunch when we were shooting the Giver, or I was with him, however you want to put it. Like I was saying, so many of my roles, I think of my dad - but this one was a little different for me. I think about my dad all the time when I am working, and maybe with this role it was a little bit more. ",
      "I'd love to do another comedy. ",
      "Well, it feels just wonderful to finally get it made. And I had a great time making it, had wonderful people to play with on this movie. And what initially drew me to it was the desire to direct my father in a movie, because my kids were quite young, and I wanted to make a movie that they could see, and so I was reading children's book catalogs, and I came across this photograph of a cover of a book, with an old grizzled guy on the cover, and I thought \"oh, my dad could play that guy.\" And i also noticed the big Newberry award stamped on the cover, and I thought it was a must read. So I looked at the book, and found it to be a wonderful children's book, but it also really affected me as an adult. And then of course I later found out that the book was being taught in schools, and they had curriculums about the book, I was excited, I thought it would be quite easy to get made, but that turned out not to be the case. Probably because a lot of the financiers were concerned about the darker aspects of the book. And I'm so grateful that Walden Media & the Weinstein Company were courageous enough to help me get this movie made. ",
      "With Starman I can remember going into the audition, and I remember this idea of Starman being a guy who was impersonating a human being, and was almost operating the human body as if he was inside it, like as if it was a ride. And so with the simple act of crossing your legs, as humans we do that to relax, Starman would cross his legs with no real idea of what the purpose of that was, even though it's an unconscious reflex as humans, but Starman would cross them in a stilted way. And my girls were quite young then, I often observed them, and got a lot of cues off them. I looked at birds a lot, I had a great time on that movie, we got to go all across the country since it was kind of a road movie. Karen Allen was so wonderful to work with, and Charlie Martin-Smith, that's the movie that I started really taking a lot of pictures on and making these little books that I would give to the cast & crew of movies I've been involved in. That was I think the first book I gave to the cast & crew. And John was great to work with. I love that movie, Starman, I felt like John did a really good job. The special FX I thought were quite good. I especially appreciated the giver's spaceship ball, the big chrome ball that was taking off, and also, I've often thought about how Starman would make a good sequel, because now Karen is pregnant with the Starman's kid, and then what happened?

The jungle is their supermarket and their pharmacy. And no one is studying what they use to heal themselves. There used to be 200000 of them and now there's around 600. Their knowledge is dying with them and we want to help find conserve it. ",
      "Does this mean where i fell out of a car or where I took a dump? Please clarify! haha",
      "Oddly enough, I have. Premieres hardly ever have people there who want to see the film. You have a bunch of jaded film execs who just don't want the film to suck so you can keep getting work. So please enter my Omaze here. http://www.omaze.com/experiences/magic-mike-xxl I want to do this more than just this, we're testing it out and hopefully I will be doing it every premiere after that"

      "Not necessary, I air my grievances everyday",
      "I don't, but I do consider it for a split second and then I go \"I can't do it.\" It's like watching your home movies, it's just me watching me. It's weird, don't you think?",
      "Turn off your computer right now.",
      "That was the most fun I ever had. The coolest part of that episode, that you couldn't see, was the head of the secret service explaining to me what was going to happen if someone started shooting at us. What they would do to the president and where they were going to throw me in the back of a van. That was really exciting Bourne Identity stuff.",
      "I actually have quite a bit of it, and we're looking for a museum that wants to display it. I have the couch, I have the two blue stools, I have the table and chairs; the coolest thing I have is the door, which we never repainted in nine seasons. It has every scuff mark that Kramer put on it with all those crazy entrances. ",
      "We have a new episode of Comedians in Cars coming out with Jim Gaffigan, who I love, and in the episode I tell him about this joke I tried to do about, when you drop your dry cleaning off, you can go to any dry cleaner you want, but when you pick it up, you can only go to one. Which I always thought was very funny, but nobody gets it. ",
      "I believe in detailed notes and jokes, and *also* winging it onstage. But, not for your first open mic. For your first open mic, my advice to you would be to make sure you have what you're gonna do memorized, to the point that one of your friends can gently slap you across the face, and you'll still be able to get it out of your mouth.",
      "\nSure, moron. Let's hear what you got. ",
      "Our relationship is great. We have dinner, talk on the phone, and laugh as we always have. ",
      "I was just there for the one night to do my favorite thing in my life, which is standup comedy. You, on the other hand, have chosen to spend your entire life in Reading, shouldn't I really be asking you what the hell are you doing in Reading?",
      "You are a very smart and progressive person. These conversations are presently taking place. ",
      "Car mechanic humor doesn't do too well.  I try and avoid car mechanic humor. I recommend you do the same. ",
      "Hope all is well with you too! I don't do movies because I think generally the size of that content does not lend itself to great comedy; it lends itself to people saying, \"Hey, I made a movie.\" To me, the funniest things are shorter, so I think TV series or comedians in cars, I think I have a better chance of making you laugh. ",
      "Believe it or not, this is something I think about a lot. I have often wondered if there's a way to teach being funny or comedy, and George Stephanopoulos actually got me wound up enough at one point that we were going to contact, I think his name was Lee Bollinger, the president of Columbia, and we were gonna go in there, and I was going to teach a course on comedy. Because I know a lot about it, but I just don't know if it's teachable. I'm still wrestling with the idea if you can teach someone to be funny. ",
      "Very good observation and analysis on your part, Baxter. You are truly exhibiting a good comedic eye. The reason I would play straight was it was funnier for the scene. And very few people have ever remarked on this, because it was a conscious choice of mine, only because I knew it would make the show better, and I didn't care who was funny as long as somebody was funny and that the show was funny. So you have hit upon one of the great secret weapons of the Seinfeld series, was that I had no issue with that. ",
      "I just saw what is #1 on reddit and this is almost as fake as the Amazon Drone delivery system. But WOW if it was real! http://i.imgur.com/QGPoPIq.jpg\n\nThere's no way it would say Amazon just once on that box.",
      "The deal with airline food is they, everything is miniaturized, as if we're in Gulliver's Travels. I used to do a bit about the tiny airline world, about how everything is miniaturized, there's always a short delay, a little problem, we're going to be a tiny bit late. ",
      "See if she's got a roommate. ",
      "WOW. First of all, GREAT question. \n\nThat I get to do on a daily basis? Probably walk to work. I think that's about the coolest thing that there is. Or take my bike. If you can walk to work or take your bike on a daily basis, I think that's just about the coolest thing that there is.  Every morning I listen to the traffic on the radio, and they talk about how they are jammed and I just laugh.  I love traffic. I love traffic reports because I'm not in any of them. ",
      "Very early on in my career, I hit upon this idea of being the Heckle Therapist. So that when people would say something nasty, I would immediately become very sympathetic to them and try to help them with their problem and try to work out what was upsetting them, and try to be very understanding with their anger. It opened up this whole fun avenue for me as a comedian, and no one had ever seen that before. Some of my comedian friends used to call me - what did they say? - that I would counsel the heckler instead of fighting them. Instead of fighting them, I would say \"You seem so upset, and I know that's not what you wanted to have happen tonight. Let's talk about your problem\" and the audience would find it funny and it would really discombobulate the heckler too, because I wouldn't go against them, I would take their side.",
      "I am ambidextrous! Good observation. ",
      "HAHAHAHAHAHA!\n\nHAHA.\n\nHah.\n\nProbably when I open my eyes in the morning, and I go *\"Oh my god, I'm Jerry Seinfeld!* Let's get out of bed and enjoy this!\"",
      "That's an excellent choice, the one that you mentioned, because I can still remember how brutally funny that was to me. The thing about the show is that you have to realize that I had to look into the faces of those people, six inches away, so if you think Kramer is funny on TV, imagine his real face six inches from your nose, how funny that is. You can't imagine. It's impossible not to laugh. So I would.  ",
      "I still say \"hey\" to greet a lot of people like we did on the show, and I still will do thumbs up, like Kramer did. And I still say hello to people the way I said, \"Hello Newman.\" ",
      "That was really one of the great moments in the history of the show for us when we heard that. We really felt like we were doing something worthwhile. ",
      "Die. ",
      "It's way too early in the day to be drinking. ",
      "The sad truth is, people are only interested in themselves. So, if you just ask them what they are doing or what’s going on or how they feel, they generally go on for hours. I read in an article recently that you should ask people what's challenging them these days and that really sparks them. So ask them that...and then run!",
      "It would be you. And I would say \"That's it!\" and that's the end of high-fiving forever.",
      "This was something we struggled with quite often on Seinfeld. Because we had real laughs on the scenes that were shot in front of an audience, but then we would shoot other scenes that were not in front of the audience (which didn't have any laughs) and then it felt like a bit of a mismatch, so we tried to compromise and put in a subtle laugh track. I think that one of the fun things of a sitcom is feeling like you're in an audience even though you're home, watching it by yourself. I have to say I like some sitcoms with them and some without. Depends on the show. ",
      "someone asked what was my favorite conversation topic on Season 3 of CICGC: I like all of them.  Todd Barry and I had a little conversation about what do you think about what happens to all those shirts at Macy's. You walk in there, there are thousands of shirts, where do they go? They don't sell out. You don't walk into Macy's and see thousands of empty hangers, it's just one of those things that nobody talks about. I could talk about anything with another comedian as long as it's dumb.  That's the whole idea of the show right there, by the way. ",
      "We actually have just begun to entertain that idea. I'm kinda feeling like CCC should have that Carson feeling of Charles Nelson Riley coming on repeatedly, and it kinda becomes a little club that you have to get into. So yeah, I think we are gonna do it like that. It's never going to be six unknowns in a season. ",
      "You know what's funny? He doesn't even know that story.\n\nMy car was a 1973 Fiat 128 SL.\n\nIs this my coffee or yours?",
      "Very very well observed, first of all, let me compliment you on that. That moment, which I remember crystal clearly, is the enormous talent of an actor like Wayne Knight. And the script said \"Newman looks in the bag, and says Jambalaya\" but the delivery and the dance was all his. \n\n",
      "WOW. P_ro, you are DEEP. And super-observant. Thank you for understanding that I was busy and not being an a.h. I would say that I am 90% serious in my day. Comedy is no joke. ",
      "I think the best Seinfeld episode idea I ever contributed was that George pretending to be a marine biologist would find Kramer's golf ball in the blowhole of the whale. Believe it or not, we were doing both of those stories without seeing any connection that Kramer was gonna hit golf balls at the beach, and George was gonna be pretending to be a marine biologist. And it was in the middle of the week that it suddenly hit me of a way to connect the two stories. \n\nSo, I think that's probably the best joke I ever thought of on the series. But, I love when people say \"regift\" or \"giddyup\", or \"yadda yadda\". The real and spectacular...I was a very big fan of the show. ",
      "The first time I met him, that's a long story... I actually was eavesdropping on him talking to another comedian, and I wasn't even in comedy yet. But he was leaning on my car in front of the Improv on 9th Ave and 44th Street, and this would be probably 1975. That was the first time I ever saw him. But we didn't talk. But him and this other comedian were leaning on the fender of my car, and I knew that they were real comedians and I was still just flirting with it. So I don't know if that answers the question.\n\nThen when we finally did talk in the bar Catch a Rising Star on 1st Ave and 78th Street 2 or 3 years after that, we couldn't stop talking. We were both obsessed with the smallest possible issue. ",
      "No. Books take a long time, and I don't get to hear the laughs. ",
      "FINALLY I have met someone that understands the show. Thank you for your rare and perceptive analysis. ",
      "One time, a friend of mine and I decided to drive a 1967 VW Bug from Albuquerque to the Hamptons. I bought the car on eBay for $5,000 and flew to Albuquerque and my friend flew from LA, and we decided to do that for something fun to do (this, by the way, is the actual original inspiration for Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, the year was 2000 and I did this with my friend Barry Marder, who you may know as the author of \"Letters From a Nut\" by Ted L. Nancy). \n\nANYWAY, so one time we stopped in this tiny town and somewhere in the Midwest whose name escapes me at the moment, and the town was honestly no more than 2 blocks long, and we are walking on this little sidewalk that they had, and there was a guy there, walking past us, and I was wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses, and the guy says as we walk by \"Hey Jerry\" and kept walking.\n\nAnd that, to this day, so blows my mind that not only was he NOT SURPRISED that i was in this town, population 115, but that I just walked by him, he recognized me and he felt the need to say anything more than \"hi.\" Not \"what the hell are you doing here.\" I'm sure that guy is out there, somewhere. Probably on reddit.\n\nWhere'd the name come from? Something like \"you seen this? I already read it.\"",
      "We never obsess over anything that isn't mundane. Most recent was intentional mumbling. We wrote this script for this thing that you will eventually see but I can't reveal what it is at this time. All I can do is tell you is that it's big, huge, gigantic. Even bigger than that Amazon package.",
      "Have you ever seen that grilled cheese truck around here? That food picture is great. \n",
      "I work down the street from where I live.  In New York City. See ya there.",
      "Well, sometimes I try and help people with their, um, etiquette with strangers. You always have to approach a stranger as a stranger, even though you may have seen that person many times on TV, they're still strangers. So you know, I sometimes will try and help people in their approach - you can't walk up to someone that you know and act like they know you. The TV only works one way. You can't just yell at me and expect me to respond positively. You have to introduce yourself first. You can't just yell \"*HEY JERRY, C'MERE!\"* and expect that to work. ",
      "Well, I'll give you two. One was the The Rye, because we got to shoot that at Paramount Studios in LA which was the first time that we thought \"wow this is almost like a real TV show.\" We hadn't felt like a real TV show, the early years of the TV show were not successful. We had this idea of a Marble Rye and we had to shoot it in an outdoor set, and this was a very expensive thing to do, it's like a movie place there at Paramount in LA. Their standing set for New York looks exactly like it, and we thought \"this is where the ADULT shows are, the REAL shows like Murphy Brown.\" We felt like we were a weird little orphan show. So that was a big deal for us.\n\nAnd that was very exciting, we were up all night shooting it on the set of paramount and it was very exciting. \n\nThe other one that was really fun was in the episode The Pothole, Newman drives his mailtruck over a sewing machine and his mail truck burst into flames. It was really fun to shoot, and it was fun to set Newman on fire. And he screamed \"oh the humanity\" like from the Hindenberg disaster. It's one of my favorites. ",
      "Everything would have had to change. The character would have gotten married and started families, I suppose. But I still think everything has its life cycle and if you respect it, people enjoy it longer. And if you disrespect it - look at THE HANGOVER movie. If you made just one, the movie would be a comedy legend. Because they made 3, it isn't. ",
      "Yes. There was one episode where Jerry bought a handgun. And we started making it and stopped in the middle and said \"this doesn't work.\" We did the read-through and then cancelled it. A lot of other stuff happened, but trying to make that funny ended up being no fun. ",
      "I did own that car at one time. Isn't it beautiful? I sold it because I had something that was a little similar, a 907, and I don't like to have too much of the same thing. ",
      "First comment, they’re called sets. Period. I did swear a little bit in the beginning and then I didn't like how easy it was. It felt like cheating, so I stopped. ",
      "Oh this is a very painful subject. As you can probably imagine, over the 9 years of doing the show, Larry David and I sat through hundreds of ideas that people wanted to do on the show. And most of the ideas are not good. Which I saw Larry say the other day on some show, somebody asked him the same question and he said \"I know you think it's funny, but it's really hard.\" The ideas that Larry and I would respond to, I don't even know, they just need to be very unique. It's just a lot harder than it seems to come up with. And particularly for that show, where we tried to do things that were unusual, and you had to go through a lot of ideas to find the ones you like. ",
      "There's tons of those. Chaplain, George Burns, George Carlin, Joan Rivers...\n\nBelieve it or not, the idea has been explored to do some kind of CGI effect, using footage of dead comedians to get them in the car, and then we would write dialog around it. It was a total disaster, but you're not the first person to think of it! ",
      "Least favorite...I once had a Cadillac Escalade in a very metallic beige, and the color made me sick. I liked the Escalade, but a car must be in a good color, or it's useless. ",
      "Julia did! ",
      "You're absolutely 1000% right. In fact I would go so far as to say that was the key to the entire show, was that we really felt like together we were funny, and then the audience felt it, and that's how you can somehow catch lightning in a bottle. ",
      "I would say the advice I would give myself, or any young person, would be \"Keep your head up in failure, and your head down in success.\" ",
      "That's funny. ",
      "That's where that phrase comes from!",
      "The worst part...I dunno, probably the worst part of being anybody, it doesn't last forever. ",
      "Because Larry David was a Yankees fan, so we kind of would go back & forth.\n\nI'd like to try to go in once a season, yes, so I definitely will be making plans to do that. ",
      "Great, great question. Wow. I probably would have to say Charlie Chaplin in a Duesenberg.",
      "Hm. This is a good question. Well, I guess it would have to be George Carlin, since he was one of the most iconic comedians and I did have a relationship with him and we would have had a great time. ",
      "It's too obviously dumb to make fun of. And it's been made fun of by countless comedians, so that's your first signal of a subject to avoid. If you've seen 8 comedians talk about something, you want to not talk about that, unless you can talk about it in a completely new way. ",
      "This is an absurd scenario. First of all, cars and desert are a bad combination. I would only bring one car to a desert island and that would be a VW Dune Buggy. No other cars are fun in the desert. ",
      "A lot of people ask this. And yes, he was absolutely genuinely terrified by that car. Check it out - I took him for a drive in an Austin Healey 3000, which is a very unsafe old car, and he did not like it. It was one of my first episodes but it's a classic, because he kept asking me - and the more scared he got, the more it made me laugh, and it's a good one. http://comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com/ricky-gervais-mad-man-in-a-death-machine",
      "The composer was Jonathan Wolff, and we were trying to come up with something that would not interfere with the standup portion in the beginning of the show. We didn't know how iconic it was going to be. ",
      "Writer's block is a phony, made up, BS excuse for not doing your work. ",
      "The pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was we want to show how a comedian gets his material. The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that. ",
      "When Frank Costanza, George's father, said to Elaine \"Do you want a piece of me?\" when he thought that she wanted to have a fistfight. That one, we had to do over and over because nobody could stop laughing. Every time Jerry Stiller would say \"Do you want a piece of me?\" we had to stop. ",
      "The only line I quote from the show (and I'll be very impressed if anybody out tehre remembers this line) is \"If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.\" \n\nI find myself saying that to my kids a lot. It's a very obscure line, but George was working at some company where they all had lunch together, and he wasn't trying the apple pie, and the boss finally says  \"If you're one of us, you'll take a bite.\"  A lot of times kids won't want to try certain foods, and so I'll use that line. Sometimes I'll quote Newman in flames screaming \"Oh the humanity.\"",
      "HAHA! HA. HA.\n\nI have many secret talents. Let's see, what would be one I could tell you about?\n\nI'm very good at streamlining a series of activities so that everything gets done in the amount of time that I have. I am very good with the clock. Like if I have a lot of stuff to do and a limited amount of time, I'm very good at figuring it all out. I'm very efficient in everything that i do, I never waste time so that I have more time to waste. ",
      "Neither, I think your life will go on as it's been and you will never reach these peaks. My reddit associate suggests I throw you a bone. I think there's a possibility of that happening. If I had a bone, and I saw you, I would throw it at you. A literal bone, yeah, I would have to be walking down the street holding a bone. ",
      "I considered it this spring for a solid six hours. There's a fantastic energy now for some reason, on the internet particularly. Tumblr, people brought my attention to. I actually did consider it, but then I realized it would make Bee Movie 1 less iconic. But my kids want me to do it, a lot of people want me to do it. A lot of people that don't know what animation is want me to do it. If you have any idea what animation is, you'd never do it. \n",
      "Ok, I would love to! But I do forget about things, like my twitter. ",
      "I chose comedy because I thought it seemed much easier than work. And more fun than work. It turned out to be much harder than work, and not easy at all. But you still don't have to ever really grow up. And that's the best thing of all. ",
      "I know I should tweet more, but sometimes I just can't think of a tweet.",
      "1) I do kind of like in the documentary I did in 2002, called Comedian, there's one point where I'm performing at Governor's in Levittown at the absolute height of Seinfeldmania. And the club owner comes in the dressing room and says to me \"I need you offstage by 9:15.\" And I said \"what?\" And I was performing there to create a new act. It was kind of a big deal that I would come to that small club, and the owner of the club just treated me absolutely the same as everybody else, and I just thought that was so funny. That was one of my favorite moments in that documentary. That's why I wanted to go back into doing standup comedy, because as the star of your own TV show you don't get treated like that but as a standup performer you do get treated like that. It was hilarious, and absurd, but standup is a life of just brutal reality which is the opposite of the life I had been leading in LA and that I missed. \n\nPeople are eating chinese food here in the reddit office, with chopsticks.\n\n2) That's a good question. It's kind of the same answer. Going back into doing standup was very grounding because there's no faking standup.  There's no coddling in standup. There's no preciousness in standup. \n\nThank you!",
      "I did learn to surf in 1999 in Hawaii, and considered chucking my entire life to just surf. And I sometimes think I should have grabbed that opportunity, because I knew it was my only chance I was ever going to get - I was single, I had just finished the show, but I didn't do it. \n\nNo, I never got a better one. ",
      "I think the fans of every show love that show as much as anybody loves any show, that's why they make lots of shows because there are lots of people and everybody has their own opinions. I don't think there's anything like a \"best show\" I kind of hate that concept. I think awards are kind of stupid, there is no best movie or best actor, what you like is best for you. If everybody liked the same thing there would be just one dish. That's why they have a menu because everybody likes something different.",
      "We had a GREAT bench of semi-regulars. Newman, Frank Costanza, Jay Peterman - do you consider those minor characters? Because I don't. My favorite minor character was the guy who ran the parking lot who when you went to get your car, he said \"we can't do it, we can't get your car.\" ",
      "It started with wanting to be Joe Namath of the 1969 New York jets, who at that time was one of the only football players to wear white shoes. And I wanted to be like him, so I always wore white sneakers. Also, Bill Cosby on I SPY always wore white sneakers. And they were my fashion icons. ",
      "Really enjoying *Last Week Tonight* with John Oliver. I like Bill Maher. Other than that it's all \nbaseball. ",
      "\nRight now I'm really binging on Sebastian Maniscalco, and Brian Regan.",
      "I kind of like it when a little misspelling in a text causes a big problem, like when someone types \"homo\" instead of \"home\" and I like little problems like that. ",
      "And i have my own car show now!",
      "I'll get on it right away. ",
      "A cat is a small sneaky animal that manages to get by without any real relationships. ",
      "I have heard this question many times. And I find his character on Curb to be the most reasonable and logical person. And I've never understood why people think of him any other way. To me he is one of the most intelligent and perceptive people, and our minds are very synchronous. So I think he is very much like that character, maybe not as nice all the time. ",
      "Newman would be my favorite supporting character. I mean, when I got to have a real evil nemesis like Superman would have, that was a dream come true for me. There's no superhero that doesn't have an evil nemesis, and I got to have one. And I love that nobody ever asks \"Why didn't you like Newman?\"\n\nNo one ever asks me that, and no one ever questions it. There was no reason, but it was just fun. ",
      "Well when I started out in comedy in the 70s, if you didn't do clean humor you weren't getting on TV, so I started doing that so I could be on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. And then when I saw what other people were doing, I just always wanted to be a little different. ",
      "The quality of the coffee. I didn't really used to drink coffee in the 90s, whenever we would sit in the coffee shop on the show I wouldn't drink coffee, they would put coffee in the cup so it looked like I was drinking it, but I wouldn't drink it. I don't know what changed. But I got into it, in the 90s and I finally figured out why everybody was interested in it, and then I became obsessed with it, and then I did a show about it. There's just - as Duke Ellington famously said - \"there's only two kinds of music, good and bad,\" and it's the same with coffee. ",
      "I will say Raisin Bran Crunch, but that's just for today. ",
      "The way we got The Contest approved is that we never said any words that anybody had a problem with, everything was implied. And nobody ever questioned it at the time. We were a little surprised, but I think it was the way that we did it that made it work. ",
      "I think the last statement would be the best way to characterize it, I was comfortable in the only medium I had at the time. And when I began my career in the 70s and 80s, you had to be clean to get on Johnny Carson or any of the shows. So that's what I became, and I found I liked it better anyways, because it felt harder and like more of an accomplishment when you could pull it off. ",
      "I place no limit on the amount coffee I can drink. I allow myself an infinite amount and I like it hot with cream. Sometimes cappuccino, sometimes americana, but nothing fancier than that",
      "Wow, that's a nice idea. The weirdest thing I ever saw on a plane... well, I don't know the answer to your question, but I will tell you a true plane story that I know. And it's true, and you're not going to believe this.\n\nI had a friend who worked as a flight attendant in the 1980s. And she was working on the plane, and she saw this weird guy go into the bathroom, close the door and come out a few minutes later. And she got this really weird feeling, and she went into the bathroom and started digging through the garbage in the bathroom. And it was full of garbage, and she pulled out everything in the garbage.\n\nAnd this is a crazy story, right? because the plane hasn't even taken off yet.\n\nShe gets to the bottom of the garbage, and there's a bomb. She finds a bomb. The guy had planted a bomb, and what it was exactly, we may never know. But she walked slowly up to the cockpit, she tells the pilot \"I found something on the plane\" and of course they call the marshals, they grab the guy, this is probably 1982 this happened. And that's really the whole story, but I thought it was one of the most amazing things, that she got that weird feeling and acted on it. Something weird's going on, and then emptying out the garbage - it wasn't part of her job, but that's the craziest story I've ever heard about the plane. ",
      "Well, I suppose I could. But it's just too far away. ",
      "That's an interesting idea. Very exotic, cool car. Can't think of a comedian high-tech enough though! ",
      "When I was in first grade on the last day of school, Mrs. Stafford, our teacher, said, \"I want to give out a special present today, to a kid in the class who has tried *so hard* to improve his handwriting.\" And she's going through this whole speech about this kid; I'm staring at this kid that I knew that she liked, and I just hated him, and I was getting more and more angry. And then at the end, she said it was me! The present was a Dr. Seuss book, *The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins*, that I have since thrown out. But I remember it was in purple cellophane wrapping, and I still consider it the greatest honor to have received that gift. So, that was my favorite book. ",
      "That really was one of the funniest things we ever did was that voicemail message. And I think I remember whose bit it was, but I'm not sure so I'm not going to say. The shrug of \"Where could I be\" may be the quintessence of the George character. ",
      "That's a good question. Probably when I was a little kid in like 7th or 8th grade, and I was watching Rowan & Martin's Laugh In, and I started watching it with a pad & pen to write down the jokes that I liked. And then I would memorize them to do in school the next day. That's when I knew I was little more into it than most people. ",
      "Oh my god, we're in Pakistan! Hello Pakistan! I have been wanting to talk to you for a long time! \n\n1) I'm sure you have funny conversations with your friends, as I do. But I decided maybe this is a show. \n\n2) Charlie Chaplin in a Duesenberg.\n\n3) There are so many comedians that I love that I haven't yet talked to! Lately I've been watching a lot of Bill Burr on YouTube, I really like him and I'm going to try to get him on the next round of shows.\n\n4)  Yes. It would.\n\n5) Good one. Good question. Well obviously, people that are holding their phone and talking to you while they're looking at their phone. The competitive phone talker! \n\n6) Very good joke reference. Yes, well, one of the great things that my generation, that we're doing, is extending our childhood into our 60's, so I will not be heading to Del Boca Vista.",
      "Thank you Tashi. I am burned out. And you may have noticed that I tend to quit things soon after doing them, like TV series, animated movies, book writing, broadway plays. I do feel very strongly in stopping the second I feel like I'm not excited anymore, whatever I'm doing. ",
      "Yes, it shouldn't pull the fabric, and it shouldn't show, you know, more than a certain amount of breastbone. It is a tricky button. ",
      "No, I don't know why. And I've had some good salsa. But I really don't think it beats ketchup. People probably like it because they can see the tomatoes in it? Whereas with ketchup, you have no idea where this came from. ",
      "Blue. In fact, I felt as a child that i related more to blue than my own name. I have a very powerful connection with that color. And it's always been extremely important to me. It's weird, I don't understand it myself, but there's certain blues - Jeep Wrangler makes a blue that will make me stop walking on the sidewalk, and just turn and stare at it. ",
      "Bee Movie was definitely my favorite movie that I've starred in, because I've always wanted to be a bee. They seem to have the most organized society on earth, and they make honey! Which is a pretty amazing product.",
      "I don't think he did have serious health issues at that time. We certainly wouldn't have made all those death jokes if we knew that. But it was really wonderful that we got to be together that one last time. ",
      "Oh. Well, there were a couple of times when I definitely thought that everything had completely come to a halt. At one point, in the early 80s, I got a part on a sitcom called Benson. And I was on the show for 3 episodes, and then I got fired. And I thought that would be the only break I was ever going to get. It was just a youthful lack of perspective. But at the time, I thought that was it. But it really ended up making me really get into being a much better standup comedian so that I wouldn't be dependent on other people. It ended up being a good thing. The best things in my life have been the bad things that taught me stuff. ",
      "How minor?",
      "\"Do you come here often?\"\n\nThat was a joke. \n\nHow about one of George's lines from The Opposite? \"I'm unemployed, and I live at home with my parents.\" ",
      "But Larry and I used to have gigantic laughs writing the show, and I remember one of the first times - when Newman had to take the stand in a courtroom scene, and I believe Kramer cross-examines him, we laughed pretty hard writing that. And I also remember writing the last speech of the marine biologist, where George tells the story of finding the golf ball in the blowhole of the whale. That was a really, really long hard laugh when we wrote that. ",
      " Larry David and I discovered that we were both obsessed with superman and admired him and also found him very funny at the same time, so that is why he came up a lot. Are you related to the hot dog Kobayashi in Coney Island?",
      "I was so happy that they made another Superman movie! I'm really reluctant to be critical of it in any way. But I thought the glossing over of the figuring out a secret identity and why he felt he needed one was a huge missed opportunity for that character, and one of the most interesting things about Superman is the whole secret identity. So to me it was too much action / violence and not enough character study. ",
      "I can deny it categorically. You can't count seeing the little Superman model on the bookshelf as a Superman reference. I would say there are maybe 10 Superman references out of a whole 180 or so episodes, so that's a long way from all of them. ",
      "I was happy with the Seinfeld finale because we didn't want to do another episode as much as we wanted to have everybody come back to the show we had so much fun with. It was a way to thank all of the people who worked on the show over the years that we thought made the show work. I don't believe in trying to change the past but I'm very happy with it. ",
      "1) Working with the cast was pure heaven for me. We were as well suited to each other as it seems when you watch the show. We enjoyed each other's company enormously. That was one of the big things that made the show work, I think.  \n\n2) Well, there have been many. I think for me, one of the most incredible is in this week's episode with Louis CK, the 2 italian gentlemen at the beginning of the show, we found them right there. I just said to the PA to see if they could find 2 italian guys to argue about the car, and he came back 5 minutes later with 2 italian guys. And that was just so shocking. If I told you to go out on the streets of New York to find 2 old italian guys to argue about a car, it would take you what, 10 minutes, 20 minutes?  We filmed it at Orchard Beach in the Bronx, and that Josh Ricks was able to find 2 italian guys... I said \"How did you do that?\" \n\nThe fact that the show is even a show is the most amazing thing to me. To me, it's a very personal fanciful notion of a show that I didn't ever think could go beyond the comedy geek community.  And it seems to. Here I am on reddit!",
      "This is hilarious to me, that somehow I am getting credit for making an X on a calendar with the Seinfeld productivity program. It's the dumbest non-idea that was not mine, but somehow I'm getting credit for it. ",
      "I don't think I need one...? It seems to be doing just fine. ",
      "Somtimes after a show on the road, I will find a place to have a cigar in an alleyway next to the hotel with a friend of mine, and I find that very relaxing. Also, driving relaxes me a lot and listening to music or sports radio. ",
      "First, that is not a correct usage for the word \"iconic\". Advice cannot be iconic. \n\nThe best advice I ever got was from Rodney Dangerfield, who when I asked him a question about something in comedy, just looked at me for a second and then went, \"You'll figure it out.\" ",
      "Yeah, I remember reading about a lot of baseball players, Wade Boggs, I think a lot of athletes have very careful preparation routines that they do before a game. And all comedians are kind of the same, there are a lot of similarities actually between comedy and baseball. It's something you can do every day, and you have a routine that you need to do to get you in the right mental place to do it. ",
      "HAHA!\n\nThat's funny. I like the typewriter style. And I actually have one of those little chrome handles to reset it back to the margin as I eat. ",
      "I have a few old Supermans with the Curt Swan art from the 60's. But nothing impressive. I have a really nice model of Kal-El being loaded into the rocket and then another model of the rocket landing in from of Ma and Pa Kent. Those are my best Superman collectibles.",
      "Regretfully I have not yet enjoyed it. I'm sure it's wonderful. ",
      "Why are the memories more important to you than the show and the laughs? I think the laughs are the most important part. But if you prefer to just remember the laughs, then have the laughs. That's your business!\n\nI do often talk to the cast, but not as often as when we were doing the show. Remember when you were in high school? Remember those people? It's like that. ",
      "Yes. She does. And we're all very happy with it. ",
      "Yeah, I think the kids do - my kids are a little sarcastic, they like to look at me and just say \"*Really...?\"*\n\nSo yeah, they're definitely picking it up. \n",
      "First of all, thank you so much for liking Bee movie. Animated stuff is a little effort-intensive. And the complete opposite of being in front of a live audience. So as much as I like the final result, the process was a little tough for me to do. ",
      "That's a good question. I don't know if the average person would like it. I really like it. I think it might surprise them that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. I think most people think of it as a problem, but it's all in how you look at it. But I do think that's the case, you get a lot more than it costs you in privacy invasion or whatever. I think people know a lot about being famous these days. When I first became well-known in the '90s, the world, the celebrity world was not as explored as it is now. Now you can really see these people and how they live, and so I don't know how much would be surprising. I'll tell you what: there's a lot of vulnerability to it. You are much more vulnerable to certain things, along with these advantages there are also some great vulnerabilities. ",
      "No, I don't, unless they somehow end up on a planet with a Red Sun where Superman would have no powers. ",
      "I don't remember. A lot of the shows were written by lots of people, different ideas were thrown in by different people every step along the way. So there's a writer listed for that episode, but in many cases they are only responsible for 20% of it because we had a huge writing staff and everybody would help everybody every week because it was very challenging. ",
      "It probably went back to the prop department where it came from. ",
      "It's usually, the kids and I will go get bagels and lox on a weekend. And then we'll come home and eat them. ",
      "Mint Chocolate Chip. ",
      "I did hear about that! Did anybody see it? Was it funny? ",
      "The calls at the beginning are not scripted, but they are real phone calls. So they know I am going to call. \n\nI am a big fan of John Mulaney. I would love to have him on the show sometime. ",
      "Good question. I do have a number of things from the show, some really cool stuff. I have the 2 green couches, and I have that intercom that was on the wall of the apartment, that I had to press whenever someone came over. I also have the toaster from the coffee shop. I won't donate them to the Smithsonian, because they don't guarantee they will display things, so I would donate them to a museum that will put them on display. I would love to donate them somewhere. I have no use for it at this point. ",
      "Thank you!",
      "Not unlike yourself, I have thrown out my old sneakers. ",
      "It makes me feel very small and repetitive. [laughing]",
      "First of all, I love being called Mr. Seinfeld. In fact, all my children call me that. It's funny that you should ask this, because this was something I loved to do as a kid with my friends was sit on my stoop and think \"what would we do when we were rich\" when we were kids in Long Island. And I remember thinking \"The greatest thing you could do if you were rich would be to have a go-kart track.\" \n\nI don't have one. I do have a long driveway in my house in Long Island, and sometimes I ride on it on a scooter. And that makes me feel like Richie Rich. \n\nRichie Rich, that comic book, made me anxious. Just the whole thing was kind of weird, it brought out strange, uncomfortable emotions of envy, and you know, sadness. He had parents, but it was one of the most depraved comic books of all. I wonder if it still exists, it can't possibly still exist. ",
      "The best drive, of course, is the Taconic, other then that anything in Westchester off the main highway is pretty good. I just love driving honestly, I don't really care where I am. ",
      "Oh no. Patrick is one of the silliest, funniest, most entertaining people I ever had the privilege of working with. He's the most difficult actor to work with in Bee movie, because every time he would come in to read, I would end up lying on the floor weeping with laughter. ",
      "Hi, glad to talk to another bee fan. What the bees can teach us is that no matter how small your job is, if you do it well, it makes a big difference. Why don't you go back to your job?",
      "Hmm. My favorite classic car would be the Porsche 550 Spyder, from the 50's. It's a very futuristic 50's car, it's all aluminum, mid-engine, very powerful for a small car, and very exciting to drive. ",
      "I think when I was about 9 or 10, and we started learning how to make human gas sounds. Those were some pretty big laughs. ",
      "I think you're wrong. I think it would be lame, and I think it would be an embarrassment to the nice place that the show occupies. I'm absolutely happy keeping it the way it is. You can't keep asking for more of certain things, you know? one of the keys to life is having a sense of proportion, knowing how long to sit at a restaurant after you've eaten, or how long you should go on vacation - if you go to Hawaii for a month on vacation, I guarantee you that by the end you'll hate it. So it's the same with a TV show, you want to do a certain amount of it, so that when people look back on it and they love it. I could have easily done the show for one or two or three more years, but it would have changed the way people look back at it. I think I made the right decision. Because people like the show now even more than they did in the 1990s, because it didn't get worn out. ",
      "First of all, it's bio pic. Not biopic. Who would I cast to play me? Who would be good playing me? It's very hard to play a standup comedian, or a baseball player, it always looks fake when an actor tries to do it. Daniel Day-Lewis would be too heavy. You know who I think would be good? Would be Matthew Broderick. He's got a good small funny. You need a small funny to play a comedian, not a big funny. Most comedians, you know, in their daily life are small funny, it's the little looks, the little things that they say, they're not clown-y. ",
      "And nobody was really exactly sure what it was. ",
      "Oh. The worst advice is, you know, you have to do more to promote yourself. That's the worst advice. The best advice is to do your work, and you won't have to worry about anything else. ",
      "Truthfully, I loved working on every episode, we just had the best time and got along great, and there were a number of years when the show wasn't successful and we still loved it. And I was very surprised by Festivus catching on, but I think people just like the line rhyming Festivus with \"rest of us\" is 90% of it. And no presents, and you don't have to buy decorations, it's just an aluminum pole. ",
      "Hmm - my favorite alcoholic beverage would be a glass of Italian Chianti in an Italian restaurant. ",
      "Well, I would suggest following up \"What's the deal with that\" with *\"I mean, really, how is this possible? You have GOT to be kidding me.\"* See if that makes you feel any better! ",
      "Let's see. I probably, um, what would I end? Boy, they're all so bad. I guess I would end the war in the Middle East, right now. And I think a really juicy white peach might do it, because one bite and it's just running down all over your chin and your hands, and you have to stop everything you're doing. ",
      "No, not true. ",
      " Tommie Agee, Number 20. ",
      "Except for Kramer with the bad peach. \n\nOr maybe it was a grapefruit? I think it was a bad piece of grapefruit section. He bit it and then spit it out at the same time. I still have no idea how he drank that beer and puffed that cigarette at the same time. I saw it the other day at some kind of a clip thing, and I don't think he has ever gotten the proper appreciation for that amazing trick. ",
      "Wow. First of all let me say that I'm not that interested in new material. If I like somebody, I love hearing their great material, it doesn't have to be new. But obviously the answer is George Carlin. ",
      "I don't know if people were surprised, I would have to see all of their eyebrows to see if they go up. But meditation helps because it's the ultimate way to rest when you're working. It's just as simple as that. ",
      "I've never met Nicolas Cage, but I heard that he had an Action Comics number one. Which I don't have. So maybe he would win that. ",
      "HAHAHA!\n\nI love the self-mocking title of that series of movies. I would not consider being in one. I think I'm completely expendable. ",
      "Well I haven't made any plans for our future episodes. We just finished making the six that will run this season and I don't know what is coming next. ",
      "I think we just thought it was a funny-sounding doctor name? ",
      "More lunchmeat? Why does it need to be more specific? It's meat, and they're telling you when to eat it. ",
      "I didn't come up with it, it was the invention of Dan O'Keefe's father, who was a writer on our show. We never anticipated anything. I anticipated it would be a good idea that would get us through this week. ",
      "It's hard to tell with comedians, because it's very difficult for a comedian to find that other format to be funny in, after you've learned how to be a comedian, it's a very difficult thing. And that's one thing a comedian needs to get to the next level, is that second format - you can perform in a club, but you need to be able to do a second type of thing that is similar, whether it's a talk show or a sitcom or a movie, or driving around in a car getting coffee. ",
      "No. Who are these people? ",
      "1) I try to do that in some way and from now on, I'm going to mention in the show, before it starts, why I picked that car for that person.\n\n2) Sure. It's a little inconvenient though, since they're in England.\n\n3) I have driven a car on a track, but I have never been in a race nor would I ever be in a race. I don't want to be faster than somebody else, that seems like a psychological problem. \n\n4) I have never had an Acura but I would own an Acura, and without Acura, there would be no Comedians in Cars show. They have been absolutely enabling us to continue doing it. ",
      "One time I got bullied, yeah, I think it was second grade. It was a kid, who I would bring little Matchbox cars with me to class, and he would make a fist at me, and then take the cars. Then one day he came over to my house and wanted to play with me, and I refused. And I never saw him again. But I still remember that. I just remember him taking the cars, and him making this fist at me. And he thought we were friends, that was the weird part. ",
      "We improvised virtually nothing, as a matter of fact. That's how good the actors were, that it sometimes seems like they are improvising. But we also knew each other so well that we knew exactly what sentences to put in their mouths that would seem natural. We just knew how they talked as people and as the characters, and that's what's really fun about the TV series is that you become an ecosystem where people feed on each other. The actors would inspire the writers and the writers would inspire the actors and it becomes a tropical depression. ",
      "I'm doing his show in September, I'm going to ask him about that. ",
      "My ideal music festival, hmm, okay. Sinatra, Beatles, Steely Dan, Carol King, Bruce Springsteen. ",
      "HAHA!\n\nI would pick my own fictional parents from the TV series. They were a little less crazy. But George's parents were more fun to have on the show. They were really funny. ",
      "I liked the ones that I was in. I felt I brought a certain something to it. \n\nI have a lot of favorite episodes. The pothole, the marine biologist, the yadda yadda, the Soup Nazi, the contest. ",
      "Definitely Bond Villain, but some people felt I was a little bit of a villain during my appearance on Louis. It wasn't a real villain, but I was a little mean. ",
      "Haha! Well you should always eat or drink whatever they're eating or drinking on the show, so pause it when they get to a thing where they are eating or drinking something, and then go out and get that thing if you don't have it. ",
      "I have already done that, where the hell were you?",
      "No more tired than I am of everything else. ",
      "I had a great time being on SNL. But I didn't think that I was one of those great hosts that had all these different things that they could finally do on that show. So I think it's better when other people host it. ",
      "I'm a dog person, but we had a cat one time, and I really liked it. I think it's very strange that men like dogs and women like cats because women want attention and men want to be left alone, it should be the complete opposite. ",
      "Some people never quite get past that 20 minute phase, where they have that good 20 minutes, and even though they're enormously talented, they don't stay long enough for the public to find out about them. Here's a name, Ronnie Shakes, he's a great great comedian, he did a few Tonight Shows and passed away at a young age. You can see him on Youtube and I think you might like him. ",
      "I don't know, it's very hard to move things around in time. Things exist because of time, in many cases. But I think funny is always kind of time-proof, so I think it could have worked even today. Obviously it would have been a completely different type of show. But you know, what made the show work was the bringing together a bunch of great actors & great writers in one place at one time. And that's just kind of like how a tornado happens, nobody really knows, it just happens. \n\nMy favorite thing on a bagel is vegetable cream cheese and double-smoked lox. ",
      "No, we didn't think that, and there are a few examples of things that we completely ignored that this would not make any sense in the future. But we did try really hard with each episode to make it the absolute best we could so that it would hold up over time. ",
      "Good question. I would describe it as \"a very funny show from the 90's\"",
      "No, that was in the script. ",
      "You know what happens is people tend to get married and have families and it's like the friends you grew up with from highschool, people ask \"you were such great friends, do you still get together with them\" but when your context changes in life, those things become more difficult. ",
      "Haha! \n\nUm, most of the time it seems if you're wearing the right-sized pants, you don't need one. I wear it with a suit because you always tuck the shirt in, and it helps keep the shirt in. ",
      "Oh my god, that question is overwhelming to a guy like me. Well whenever my kids ask me this question, I always answer with \"Two peanuts were walking along, one was assaulted.\" And I like that joke because anybody can tell it, and it always works. And it's very short. ",
      "That is a good question. Well, the cell phone. The first cell phone, the Motorola Star Tech. When I got the first cell phone, I thought \"we're in the future now.\" I didn't get the bigger battery. ",
      "Sweden. Oh! I love everything about Sweden. I would say Saab motors, which is now sadly defunct, although there are rumors they are going to revive it, but I LOVE Saabs. I had a Saab in the 1980's, it was the first car I bought with money I made doing comedy, and it was a Saab 900 Turbo. I had it for six years. I kept it, maintained it beautifully, and I don't remember who I sold it to. But that's what began my Porsche problem, because then I started making really good money, and then the Porsche situation happened. ",
      "He didn't threaten anyone with it, but he did very suspiciously keep it under his long coat and it made everybody nervous. ",
      "Velvet clothes? I've never owned any velvet clothes. I know George's dream was to drape himself in velvet. But I think we just thought that was something funny to say. ",
      "I would say, when I heard that they were going to do a sitcom with a secret agent who was funny, that it was going to be a comedy secret agent TV show, and it was going to be called \"Get Smart,\" the back of my head blew off. So that was really my favorite show when I was a kid. Also Laugh-In and Batman. ",
      "The idea was to take a car from 2014, and transport it through a time tunnel to an ad agency in 1965 that is somewhat incompetent. And Acura liked the idea and wanted me to do it, so we did it. ",
      "Ricky's one of my favorite people. He's one of those the second you step into the same room that he's in, you're laughing. He's just got comedic energy that I love. ",
      "No, I didn't, we just thought it was a funny product. ",
      "You know what? I know Bill, I have not talked to him about this, but the whole Bill & the Mets thing I don't get at all. He's living in Bel Air, California. I don't understand how he has a relationship to this team. ",
      "George Carlin really seems like a VW Bus kind of guy. But one of the things i do is I talk to the guest first, and see if they have any car interest of any particular kind, and then if they do, sometimes I will pursue that. ",
      "I can't give a single answer, but I will say it's definitely between Italy, Norway and Australia. ",
      "Absolutely! I think Subarus are really cool. I love the flat engine design, and they have wonderful engineering. ",
      "The battery life wasn't bad. Almost the same was now. You could survive fine with that one. I'm sure that someone still has a working one. ",
      "We're still very good friends. And I actually see them pretty regularly, whenever we're in the same city. ",
      "It's very nice. It really is funny, it's very easy for me to remember that the show was very unsuccessful for a number of years, the first 4 years, and I remember thinking \"I don't know why people don't seem to like this, it seems so funny to me.\" But I never thought it was going to be a big success. But it worked out. ",
      "My lucky numbers are 9, 5, 18, 54, and 32.",
      "Well, the question doesn't really make sense, because what's the talent if I'm not funny? If I'm not funny, I have no talent. But I think I know what you're asking, and I think I would be interested in graphic design. I really like that world of arranging colors & shapes in a pleasing way. ",
      "Larry David is not really that much like George in real life. George is a little bit angry. And does not care if he has to break the rules to get what he wants. And Larry David is not like that at all. Larry David is a very considerate and respectful kind of person. George is not. ",
      "Millions. I have millions of things like that. Someone once gave me a Superman insignia keychain that I clipped onto my backpack, I know I am going to lose it someday and I will be devastated, because I just love it. ",
      "I've always liked airline travel. I think anytime you get to leave earth, it's pretty special. ",
      "You are way too self-involved. In an audience of thousands of people, no one is looking at you. You need to be more aware. I don't see people in the audience, I'm in an ultra-focused state when I'm onstage, I only go by sound - I listen to the audience but I don't look at anything in particular. I'm really visualizing the stuff I'm talking about. ",
      "Uh, okay, thank you. ",

We had funny making the Comedians In Cars getting Coffee logo, that was a lot of fun, I did that with an advertising agency, but when we finally got that all arranged, I really liked it. I wanted the show to have a homemade garage band feel, which is what it is, I mean, it's 4 people in the whole show, including me. We have 2 producers, 2 editors, and a cameraman. Plus me and the guest, but the guests don't really work on the show, they just go out for coffee. ",

I got out of the car, and I went back to her pickup truck, I opened the door, and there was this middle-aged lady who was drunk in the middle of the day, the smell just came, you know, pouring out, and I slammed the car door, and I banged on the hood, and then I left because I didn't want to spend one more second of my life around that person. \n\nI also hate when people don't wave back when you let them in.

So when you're old, you get to relax a little bit. And you can see much more clearly of what's going on in the world. When you're young, everything is really confusing, and when you're old you can see through people and events really clearly, and I like that a lot. So I think getting old has as much advantages as disadvantages. The worst thing about getting old is your knees aren't so good. But if you exercise, it's not bad at all. ",

He hit me up in like 2015? to help work on his new album, we ended up writing a track together which involved an insane amount of back and forth. it was an amazing process. He was working with some other DJs on more electronic music, and i was like DUDE... lets make a song like Rage Against the Machine which has never been made before, and we did ...it slotttters.\n\nthen we spent over a year working with vocalists, and ended up working with Big Boi [OutKast] and Killer Mike [Run The Jewels] - it is HEAVY DUTY!!!\n\nbut waiting on Tom Morello to release it, he is working on a whole album so im just chillin :)\n",

      "well for one, I can't really speak about \"EDM Shows\" with authority, because that's not what I do. I see \"EDM\" as Avicci, Tiesto, Afrojack, Skrillex, etc. there is certainly crossover in Bassnectar Land, but i choose the road less taken. I come from a different place, and have different ideas, and so a lot of times the standard/classic EDM SCENE is irrelevant to what I do. But of course there is a crossover. In general with drugs, I did some experimenting a long time ago, and I know there are potential positive experiences to be had for SOME people. Unfortunately, I have seen so many horrendous tragedies (death, ruined lives, ruined relationships, ruined careers, ruined nervous systems) that I just do not wish to encourage drug use. In fact, I have a lot of problems with legally sanctioned Pharmaceuticals as well (not all of them of course). But pushing meth onto kids, getting them addicted, but calling it Adderall, that's fucked up. Why criticize Lance Armstrong for using performance-enhancement drugs, but then all the kids in college (who aren't diagnosed with ADHD) take it to do better in school. I think drugs is just such a loaded topic, it's hard to respond quickly.",

I gotta say our tours evolved into something so special and unpredictable, and for many years both state of the art and WAY ahead of its time [aka eons before 'dubstep' or 'edm'] ...we basically started touring as a rock band in like 2005... before that for about 10 years most of what i did was grass roots and self booked. in the 90's i did not have a manager or agent, and i was mostly focused on making events happen [we did free outdoor fullmoon events everymonth on the beach or in the woods] and making music for fun, not really to DJ. when i would play a set it was super organic, and never on a stage or anything... at the turn of the century burningman was exploding as an out of this world canvas for me to paint on [as was Shambhala in Canada] and i started booking myself to fly out to play art parties in art wharehouses all over... i would play 150+ shows a year, mostly in small clubs or wharehouses. in 2003 i think i was in France, Germany, England, Ireland, Spain, New Zeland, Australia, Japan, and all over the states, but it was SUPER fucking low key and ULTRA underground.... by 2005 we started playing in rock clubs in the states, touring with a small crew as a rock band would [sound guy, tour manager, lighting dude, etc] and id be doing a pizza parlor in Arkasa on a Tuesday, some weird rock club in Tennessee on a Wednesday, off to Mississippi for a Thursday night in like a dorm room, etc etc... and then that just got more and more intense for 10 years straight\n\n\nthe last time we did an actual TOUR was 2014 when we played Madison Square Garden and at that point it was SUCH an undertaking, and so exhausting and so expensive [its unbelievably expensive to haul 4 or 5 semi trucks full of gear with 2 massive tour busses, and 25 crew members, plus plus plus alll over the place, and set up a show, run a show, tear down an show and COMMUTE] 5 or 6 times a week... it was just loco\n\nmaybe i will do it again, but the way i have it dialed now is WAY more fun, and WAY more inspiring....\n\nand honeslty a lot of my focus this year is about taking off the bassnectar suit and exploring life off grid as a human... then when i come back on grid its super full power and stunning as an experience...and again insnaely inspiring\n\n:)\n",
      "THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL!!!! :)\n\ni have experienced deeply moving and cathartic experiences of growth and change...painful upheavals, frightening chaos, isolation, confusion, deep fear...and also beauty, sunrise, mystery, awe, connection... i think it moves in cycles\n\nand we all get to play a part in each other's stories, to whatever degree we wish [which is why Random Acts of Kindness is so fun and important]....its why i never understand when someone says \"im bored\" its like...youre *what*?\n\nevery single moment of life is a chance to breathe in the beauty, the mystery, the awe of life... we are miracles, even at the WORST times, the most painful and awful, its still such a crazy coincidence that you were even born at all... its a CRAZY FUCKING MINDBAFFLING COINCIDENCE THAT YOUR PARENTS WERE EVEN BORN! much less survived everything under the sun, and made it to the point where there created you and now YOU have all these insanely complex nuances and ideas and opportunities and experiences...how can someone be bored\n\nand beyond bored, how can someone be self destructive? there are so many constant opportunities to give that even in the darkest of times, you can still make a new friend, you can still marvel at nature, you can still give countless gifts of kindness to others...\n\ni have had a lot of people reach out to me about suicide, well over hundreds, so probably several thousand, in the last few years. I've known several dear friends who have gone through with it or attempted it, and I am not trained to counsel about it, its so tender and sensitive. I used to work with this service called 211, which was like 911, but a national service for suicide prevention, but i would just direct people there and sometimes i would call three ways, but i feel and felt like i had no business really professionally counselling\n[not yet at least]\n\nso instead of that, i chose to just reflect kindness and and try to be as encouraging as i can be [nobody is perfect and its not always easy] but as with politics, i just drifted to a place more general and deep: human connection... i want to reflect that and i am overjoyed that you received that transmission\n\nhopefully as you move forward in life you too can reflect compassion and kindness and tender sensitivity toward others... reaching out and making friends and looking out for fellow humans who need a helping hand: thats what lifes about :)\n\n",
      "i love that you ask that!\n\nso musically, the inspiration was to recreate the vibe from Expanded, Breathless, and my Plugged In remix... something like \"into the sun\" but in that halftime drum & bass vibe. i was working on this for about a year, and actually it was gonna be TKO at one point...as odd as that may sound.\n\nbut the music is and was so uplifting, and i always make temporary \"work in progress\" song titles for my tracks... i started calling it Was Will Be, which is kind of a nod to Present Past & Future...to feeling a sense of timelessness... and that is very humbling and euphoric and mesmerizing at the same time\n\nbecause i realize im just a tiny blip or spark on the wheel of time, which spins infinitely, but my spark is just a split second during one of its revolutions... so anyways, i could wax poetic about that forever, but ... speaking of which i was gonna CALL the song \"Forever\" at one point.... then i started sending it out to vocalists... Lupe Fiasco, Zion I, Rye Rye, all kinds of people made really interesting concepts to it, but the one Mimi came up with was so haunting\n\nshe and i love to work together on concepts and lyrics, and although the song has very few lyrics, its super powerful to me\n\nthere are basically 3 phrases:\n\nFeel It\n\nHealing\n\nForever\n\nand i just had to rinse that over and over and have her sing it all different ways and try each way over the various melodies of the song\n\ni get goosebumps every time i hear the track\n\ni played it the first time ever this past weekend, and it was my favorite moment of the set, i felt overwhelmed and i inhaled really suddenly and tons of my own hair went into my mouth and i could barely see or breathe but was just like singing the lyrics in my mind and getting teary eyed haahaha :)\n\n",
      "honestly i LOVE the enthusiasm of the bassnectar community. i have never seen anything like it in my life and i am so proud and honored by what has so organically developed and evolved.\n\nThere are elements of the punk rock scene and even the death metal scene from my high school days, where nerds and rejects and outcasts and people who don't belong find a home, find common threads.\n\nthere are elements of Insane Clown Posse, The Grateful Dead, and Phish, where totally different people from totally different walks of life find common themes of passion and joy and develop a family which gathers to celebrate those common themes.\n\nthere are elements of my own day dreams of art colonies and cultish communes where strangers and artist collaborate and interact in some kind of Science Fiction utopia to make reality into a interactive work of art.\n\nBut all the while the people are so genuine and gentle and respectful and diverse.\n\nAs with any large, anarchic group of people, there is a spectrum of behavior... and i have always encouraged people to be INCLUSIVE and ACCEPTING so any random person can show up and act like a clown but in general i am constantly humbled by how kind and loving everyone is\n\nAn din comparison to the PHONY mass-marketed mainstream fan bases out there, this is so genuine... its made of humans, who like you and me, are imprefect and constantly growing and learning\n\ni know anyone reading this has made stupid mistakes, thought stupid thoughts, tried dumb things, and lived to tell about it... that's life\n\nbut it's FAKE NEWS to say bassnectar fans are anything but ultra amazing, dedicated, beautiful... that comes from jealous haters, or wannabees..that comes from someone who wishes life was different and tries to tear down something else which is beautiful. and i have love for those people, but no patience for their fake news.\n\n\nFor any random story about this or that conflict, there are THOUSANDS of stories of random acts of kindness, of loving friendships which have formed, of deep and meaningful experiences\n\nand that's beautiful :)\n\ncompared to any fanbase of a sports team, or any group at a college or university, or any fanbase of a musical act, it's a non issue, if you have been a member of the community you know this is special.\n\nand just as with anything [Burningman, high school, Phish, Metallica, hip hop, college football, casions in Las Vegas, taverns in Holland, traffic jams in New York City, beaches in Miami, movie theatres in Colorado, shopping malls in Seattle, forests in vancouver, whatever] as with anything there is a myriad of behavior\n\nthere are REALLY nice people, there are outspoken people, there are shy people, there are inexperienced newbies, and tired old veterans, there are high octane OVERLY INSPIRED enthusiasts, and there are poeple who are moving on to new things\n\nso as with any community YOU HAVE THE POWER to influence, and when you see newcomers, greet them with love, and when you see negativity, either extinguish it with love, or leave the scenario\n\none thing i can say is if you want to feel happier: \n\nspend less time online\n\nspend less time posting statuses of yourself\n\nspend less time trying to broadcast\n\nspend less time complaining about negative things\n\nspend less time trying to call someone out for mistakes they made\n\nspend less time listening to those who have no credibility\n\nspend more time tuning into sources of thought or information who have EARNED credibility, who are authentic and trustworthy\n\nspend more time interacting with live humans who live their lives in ways YOU want to live yours\n\nbe friends with people who have personalities which are like WHAT YOU WANT TO BECOME\n\nspend more time giving and less time taking\n\nand buckle up for a long, strange, beautiful ride :)\n\n",
      "the technical answer is that technology is changing and i can't tell where someone is allowed to post a \"real\" mixtape... to me mixtapes are CHALK FULL of samples, just like DJ sets are, and you just mix music the fuck up hella freestyle and have fun. but now you can't really post that anywhere without getting takedowns, so... find a place to post them and ill post them :)\n\notherwise im just making mixtapes live each night when i play a set\n\nevery single one is super creative and freestyle and i'm editing or remixing or remastering *EVERY* track i play\n\nalot of times ill do an edit and someone will say \"this sounds just like the original\" and im like SMH... dude slap the 2 versions into a sequencer and A-B compare them\n\ni put IMMENSE work and time into crafting custom designs on any song i play, always working to make the heaviest, warmest, deepest version possible... so live sets have really become my new playground for mixtapes :)",

      "questions that start with the words \"what ever happened to\" are difficult to answer… everyone and everything constantly changes, reacts, adapts, responds. The only thing i truly know in life is that change is constant. That said, I am excited about constantly growing and changing. For many years I have felt personally drawn towards the emotional/magical/visceral/abstract end of the spectrum, less to the political/concrete. As an artist I focus on creating the most immersive and provocative atmosphere as possible, and I focus on contributing to people's experience. I think my methods will always change form or shape, but my vision still feels 100% ;)\n\nThat said, I am so interested in current events, hot topic issues, critical thinking, etc. I love learning, and I love finding ways of filtering the constant onslaught of information into the most important pieces possible. Can i just say it is not easy for me to give short answers :)\n\nAnd yes, thank you for being an Ambassador!",
      "hi! thanks!!!!\n\nI try and plan the 'tweener music' between each set or before each set [every once in a while it doesnt happen and some sound tech will blast surf rock, which is also cool] but like last weekend i made a mix of Minecraft music, and mixed it into Imagine, and a few other doozies :)\n\ni ahve tons of little micro-sets of old records i like to give to the sound tech to play before the set begins\n\nand YES YES YES! you should watch ZEITGEIST MOVIE!!!! ITS FREE AND ONLINE! Its amazing!\n\nthat part sampled is from the end of the 1st version [i think there are 3 full length episodes/versions]\n\nwithin the first version, the bit about religion is what i found most touching, but also it gets philosophical at the end :)\n\nvery important stuff :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrHeg77LF4Y",
      "i love Einstein... i read a book he wrote called \"Thoughts & Ideas By Albert Einstein\" and if you mix that with Ray Kurzweil's \"The Age of Spiritual Machines\" and the whimsy of Tom Robbins... thats kind of the philosophy which is echoing around in my brain :)",
      "GLOMPULIN: you are my hero! i hope i can meet you some day and give you the biggest hug. My friend told me ‘you should check out this post on reddit, its really cool’ and so i came and read your post and i just absolutely fucking agree!\n\nwhat a tragic, draining, absurd reaction to such potentially special moments: to complain… its blows my mind. Anyways, i wanted to respond to you dude:\n\n1. Totally agree, that venue was NUTS! 22,000 people in one room = BONKERS! If i did it again, we would have just made it more clear [can’t imagine how] where all the free water was, and somehow INSTANTLY waved a magic wand and got everyone through the line at once. But aside from that, on a musical level i was in total fucking heaven. i worked on that set for sooo long, and i saved so much music for it that i hadnt played in years, i wrote so many custom bits and remixes for it, and SHREDDED my tendons for literally hundreds of hours cutting up samples, loops and vocal bits. I listened to our sound board recording today and kept getting chills. \n\nAnyone who complained about the music this NYE: you just don’t like Bassnectar. and that’s fine :)\n\npersonally i fucking love it :)\ni love every second of every track, and that’s why i played it :)\n\n\n2. You are so right, after every big event, its a storm of critique and complaining. Fortunately, i have learned how to tune out, so i don’t have to deal with it. But i feel bad for y’all. If i was you i would want to float out of the event filled with bliss and just glow for a while without some dummie trying to shit on the vibe. I think the biggest problem with the critics is:\n\n- they are so often literally inaccurate\n- they speak with absolute authority, which makes their glaring inaccuracies unbearable\n- they feel some kind of entitlement to weigh in, which they shouldn’t\n- i literally DON’T WANT their feedback. nobody is asking them\n\ndon’t tell an artist what to play. i play what i love, if you don’t like it please leave :)\n\nits so simple.\n\nMy music is my art. I am an artist. You don’t tell an artist what to do, that’s so ridiculous. You either enjoy the art, or you GTFO…go make your own art, i don’t know. Go to some other show.\n\nIf i was at an art gallery where i didnt like the art, the last thing in the worrrrrrld i would do is try and tell people how the artist could have or should have done it differently. i’d just leave. and go to another exhibit, or go make art, or go chill, whatever… but why be ugly?\n\n3. I really appreciate what you said: i can drop whatever I want. and i do. and i always have. often many moons before it’s popular, and i’m willing to bet many moons before you heard it. Years before you started saying “trap” i was ‘dropping trap’. I’d bet that years before you knew what filth was, i was dropping it. now that sounds cocky as hell, but i’m just saying it for real. I was also mashing it up with melodic downtempo, or vocal samples i loved, or whatever… i was just playing whatever TF i enjoy, and whatever I felt the desire to play. And I always will. musical freedom is essential to creativity. I am not catering to anyone, and in fact decided today i’m gonna take down the request line because i don’t want these kids misunderstanding: i play what i want, its my art :)\n\nSo the wannabe OG kid with his heady wrap on sitting in a Motel 6 trying to tell you about how many shows he has been to and why nectar sucks now, the irony is that THOSE are the guys i literally cannot waiiiiiiiiiit to get rid of….because that is definitely not a true fan or a real bass head. If he was a real bass head, he would know how important it is to be kind when you have the opportunity, to open your arms and welcome new and different people in, to explore and adventure into new sounds, and to expect the unexpected. He would also know i will never cater my music to him or to anyone, and if he is a fan, he should enjoy it. If not, BY ALL MEANS that dude should go somewhere else.\n\nI literally remember last New Years in Birmginham, the next day i hear several people saying “man he played too much original music, it was too predictable” [i had not even noticed that, or considered that] and then this year, they were all caught off guard and now they are complaining they don’t recognize it or…whatever they complain about, i honestly don’t know because i make it a habit to not focus on their nonsense or bad attitudes.\n\ni just really love what you said man, and hopefully you wake up the real fans: after a gigantic magical celebration just ENJOY yourselves!!!! focus on what you love….\n\nlife is so short, stop trying to complain: if you are complaining about the music i play you are literally the exact person I do not want at my shows.\n\nSo Glompulin, thank you dude for saying all that :)\n\nNow i saw someone say something really dumb below and i need to go tell him…\n\n\n",

I trade tracks with all those guys regularly. Flux actually asked me about helping him raise his jellyfish recently, but i decided not to get involved! ;)\nI have several Dr P tracks which he claims no other DJs want to play, so i've enjoyed playing them exclusively, which is a thrill! all those guys are great.\n3. As for Festivals: Artists don't pick which festivals we play. Instead, the coordinators of each event decide who they want and then make an offer to the artist's agent. Most large festivals simply do not repeat headliners (Lolla, Coachella, Spring Awakening, Bonnaroo, etc) and Electric Forest is the same. They simply said they would love to have me back in 2014, and this year they are having PL (whom they did not invite back last year). If it was up to me i would play every festival every year, haha! As it happens we have so many festivals planned this year, i am bursting with excitement! I wish I could announce them all right now!!!!! ;)",

      "hey!\n\nThat double show in Tahoe was intense. partly because Tahoe is so special to me! But also because of the ungodly pain in the ass of that Fire Marshal. Nobody on my crew has ever encountered someone that insane (he told me he was religiously opposed to everything i stand for! hahaha) ...and the subs did not blow there. The system \"shut of\" and then \"could not be turned on again\"...it was hella suspicious. They told me i could not say anything about the Fire Marshall or they would arrest me for starting a riot. It was such a strange experience!!!!\nAs for other artists i recommend, I cannot say it enough: EXPLORE THE CLASSICS! There were universes of artists and micro-scenes in the 1990's (and before) who were creating insane music, and now it's as if nobody remembers. Check out entire sub genres like how techno started merging with 'breakbeat' and became 'hardcore' and became 'jungle' and became 'drum & bass'...find some crazy ravers who kept their record collections and let them school you!!!! i do that regularly. :)",

      "hi :)\nlet me assure you it is not EVER about \"having no love\" for a place or an area. We plan our tours carefully: A short/tight Spring Tour, a Summer full of festivals, a big/bananas Fall Tour, and a few one offs, as well as New Years. Its been like this for years. Each city we play in the fall, we PROBABLY won't return to in the Spring. Last Fall there were all kinds of people complaining that we weren't in Atlanta, or Philly, or Rochester, etc. So we spread the love. Also, most big festivals have radius clauses, so for example by deciding to play Spring Awakening, we cannot play in Chicago in the Spring. And that makes sense to me :)\nAnyhow, if you notice that your city is missing from our schedule it either means we have a huge festival nearby coming up (possibly not yet announced) or it means we have big plans for the Fall Tour 2013 in your area.",
      "this year i'm trying something new, and it's been going really well.\n\nLast December/January, i made a list of EVERY 'bassnectar song' [off albums, remixes, etc] and i made a list of every event we have planned for 2018 [i think 26 sets?]\n\ni picked ONE event for each song.\n\nthen i went through my entire record collection that is programmed/warped/initialized in our Ableton UNS System [the Ultimate Nerd Server is custom software which syncs the music to video, lights and lasers] and picked one or two events to play each at. \n\nby the time i got done i had more than enough music for each event, and then i figured of course there will be a ton of new material popping up, and im sure i'll want to play several songs way more often than that...\n\nbut it made a bunch of really cool, precious moments. so like with BASS HEAD, i decided to rock that \"Hi my name is BASS HEAD\" concept at Okee night two, cuz it was like the first kick off set of the year, and it felt like \"WELL HELLO, 2018, WHAT THE FUCK IS UP\" :)\n\nand Lions I hadn't played in ages, so i got that ready for Okee... but then Buku i was dying to play my Joker remix and that mixes SO well into Lost In The Crowd... so i planned that out for Nola, planned out the James Brown concept for Okee [but also that was the version where i mix out of Science Fiction!!!! and i wanted to do the full version at BOnna - spoiler alert]\n\n\nand Chicago, like... alot of that was planned specifically for chicago, and many cuts i hadnt played in months or years, and then many more which i won't play for many moons to come\n\nso i have this pretty killer road map leading all the way to New Years, full of special plans and ideas... but it's full flexible, and i can add/subtract/mutate as i go\n\nspent the last few months remixing constantly... there is so much good music being created these days, and i absolutely HAVE TO edit or remix or flip anything i hear and love, so its really like i just have beautiful sounds coming out of my ears :)",
      "as long as its not setlists or clips on youtube im fine ;)\n\ni would say come to Freestyle Sessions or Bass Center if you are really curious, because those events are created from scratch, and we are all obsessing over every tint detail, living and breathing EVERY detail with so much love and imagination\n\nif you find yourself on a forum with bozos debating a setlist, that sounds like the most boring life ever, so keep them away from that nonsense :)",
      "So seriously, to the other folks i was just wanting to speak frankly, not personally. but to you this is personal: i want you to understand you are LITERALLY the kind of guy who makes and artist want to stop being an artist. You are literally spewing draining, toxic nonsense, and you're doing it with a self righteous attitude as if you're some authority on me or my art. you are literally the exact person i hope never comes to a show again.\n\ni am not saying this to be mean, i am saying it because i know there are hundreds of people like you and i want them all to stop coming to our shows. we want to gather kind, fun, loving people....we want to inspire them and challenge them, and slather them in art and music and caring energy... musically i will and can do whatever i want\n\nyou've been seeing me since 09 and yet you sound like a clueless burn out.\n\nhow can you be convinced i don't give a fuck when i give my heart and soul for decades? \n\nyou think i secretly hate my fans? let me explain this:\n\ni looooooooooove my fans [but i have the respect to not think of them as fans, i think of them as awesome participants in an interactive art project, and i cherish them. but a true fan would NEVER tell me what to play...and would never look so clueless and lie like you do]\n\ni love my fans but i cannot STANNNNNNNNNND trolls like you. you are literally poisonous. i don't mind if it seems harsh, its just true. \n\nOn New YEars Eve the level of intention i put into the messages was exhausting. I worked nonstop all December on that set... I havent played some of those songs in many years. i have gone multiple sets this year TRYING not to play breathless so i could save it for the countdown... i have remixed the BAJEEEEEEZUSSSSS out of so many next level creations by other awesome musicians and friends, i worked for a week with sebastian and a whole crew on that video for Other Worlds to premier it on video screens coming down at you from the sky with vocals saying \"Do you imagine...you can get away\" [to other worlds] \"lose that let your head go, just let it go\" \"do you imagine you can get away?\"...music is the drug\n\nPLEASE keep listening to rinse FM and patting yourself on the back man\n\ni am guessing you are a pretty bad ass DJ and an incredible musician the way you are spouting your mouth... \n\nalso this word you say \"recycle\"...what. the. fuck. \n\nour entire culture is based on sampling. Dj culture is based on sampling. electronic music is based on sampling [and synthesis, but blah blah] when an artist creates 13 albums of music, and they play those songs they aren't \"recycling' they are playing their music... if a DJ creates crazy custom edits or has a favorite track and wants to play it every night, they aren't \"recycling\" they are sampling THE HEAT, and dropping it at the perfect moment...\n\ni reinvent all the music i make and create new versions... i customize every track i hear from other people, and smash it all together into custom adventures as an art form. im not saying it's qualitatively good\n\ni am just saying i love it personally, i love what i do, i celebrate the freedom to do it, alot of other people seem to like it\n\n\nso.... what the FUCK are you doing here?\n\n",
      "haha well, in terms of \"my life outside of bassnectar\" that is an entire universe i am VERY excited to explore! in 2015 I kind of had an American Beauty Moment... i felt like i had \"been in a coma for about 20 years, and im just now waking up\"...\n\ni felt like i had been in a daze for 10 years and the world blurred past, and although i had lived every bassnectar dream and then some, i hadn't had much life outside of music. i am a total workaholic, and i eat, sleep and breathe bassnectar as a 'creative art project'...\n\ni realized that 'bassnectar' was like a superman suit, and that i was just a mild mannered human, like Clark Kent. When i strapped on the suit i could fly through these crazy worlds, but i hadnt taked the suit off in ten years.\n\ni didnt want to retire or give up or stop, i wanted to respect the power and integrity of the art... but i wanted to ALSO explore life as a human being\n\nso instead of \"turning down the intensity on bassnectar\" i decided to leave it as it naturally is: pulsing with intensity!!! but to just spend less time of each year wearing the suit.\n\nSo if my life is a pie chart, each year 98% of the pie chart was Bassnectar, and 2% was left over for everything else. I made a goal to transform that to a 50/50 balance, so 50% of the time i could wear the suit, and during those times, it can blast as full on an intense as ever, but when i take it off, i can just be simple mild-mannered Clark Kent, and in those moments, i have no desire to broadcast my personality on social media or anything, i like to unplug\n\ni love spending time with my family, who i love beyond words. i love spending time with dear friends, many of whom I have known for 20 years. i love learning and thinking. i love playing Pente. i loooove nature, and i love walking and exploring. i love meeting new people without introducing myself, just being kind to an old sweet gramma at a cafe, or a tired looking waiter at a restaurant... i love visiting with my neighbors, or studying and learning new things...i love thinking constructively, and creatively, and i love debate...i debate with myself or my friends a lot, because its a great way to improve you persepctive, by enriching it and scientifically testing your beliefs... i do it for fun, i watch documentaries..\n\ni love playing Skyrim and Minecraft.\n\nmy dad said \"there are only 2 things to do today: Relax and Be Kind\" and i love that\n\nhe also said that aside from all the ever-changing advice you get from the world the 3 most important things each day for self care are getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and excercise... so i focus on that as well\n\nthen again, although i took off a ton of time this winter, i was buried in the studio almost every day\n\ni'm working on countless collaborations year round, im always messing around with old 'never-finished albums' on my old computers\n\nim lovviiiiiing NAUX FAUX, which is a downtempo project i have with my friend Craig, i love working on music with Dorfex Bos, i love just jamming on new sounds and ideas for a few hours, then deleting the project and startin over again :)\n\nlately, any time i hang with Dylan [ill Gates] instead of making music we just goof off, talk about life and the world, make each other laugh, record a bunch of noises and talk about music from a Present Past and Future approach, where nothing lasts, but everything is kind of existing in multiple states of existence\n\nwhere was i?\n\noh yah...hobbies and interests...\n\n:)",

Denons and Pioneer. i had been using vinyl before but i realized i could remic my own vrsions of vinyl, or play my own music by burning a CD and didnt need to wait for a vinyl press, etc.. at the time that was very revolutionary, as vinyl DJs were confined to only what had been pressed to wax. so i was goin NUTSO in the alte nineties playing insnaely creative sets with tons of exclusive mashups and versions, and multiple times had some yahoo troll wingnut trying to yell at me that i should GTFO unless i played vinyl... anyhow... \n\nso yah, eventually i would like to play these all with 4 or 5 turntables and do them in various cities in small rooms with no lights or anything, just bump crazy music in the dark\n:)\n\nfor this first one, i've just been focusing on the music nonstop: i have spent every week since february remixing old tunes, remastering my record collection, recording vinyl into the computer, recreating the drums and bassline, adding tons of effects and layers, or sampling the FVCK out of old classics... then just nonstop editing and re-cutting and customizing... every style, genre, tempo...\n\nmost of this music is deep and complex but not exactly what i would play at mainstage Bonaroo or in the peak moments of Electric Forest or whatever... its deeper\n\nits what would i play if it was just you and me on a road trip, or if it was just us and a dozen friends drinking wine in a tree house, or if it was just us a 5 dozen friends going APESHIT at a house party and swinging from the curtains, ... just playing anything and everything under the sun, and focusing on the fun...\n\nits not that i dont have fun usually, i definitely do! but the full on bassnectar sets like at bass center, that stuff is SO high octane and so over the top and immersive and overwhelming...its like drowning in lava or having massive tsunami waves crash down on your brain\n\nfreestyle is more like playing hide and seek in the dark with your best friends at summer camp, under a full moon, on Jupiter, with a few alien buddies joining along, while sipping mango juice, and then realiziing you are an alien and you were born on Jupiter, and all the kids you're playing hide and seek with are aliens from earth, so you are not actually an alien, you are a JUPITERIAN!!!!!\n\n\n:)",
      "wow thanks!\n\nthat's how i felt about Nirvana and Metallica when I was 12. :)\nI don't know if every song i make is good or not, but it's definitely a part of my personality :)",
      "thanks!\n\ni never made a decision to \"follow the electronic scene\". When i was 15 i was obsessed with death metal and black metal, and by 18 i was hearing lots of early techno and electronic ambient. I just naturally felt enchanted by it, and as a musician wanted to learn how to incorporate it. I started studying it formally at University of California, SC in 1996. But i never thought I would be a DJ, i didn't really care about DJs. I wanted to MAKE EVENTS HAPPEN for people. I wanted to recreate the magical experiences I had felt for other people. And i wanted to chase the sounds in my head and make them real. I've been chasing some sounds since then, and \"i'll probably be chasing that feeling for the rest of my life\".",
      "Bass Center is without a doubt the creative pinnacle of the year for my entire team!!!! It wasn't always like that but after last year, it really became a chance for me to take the deepest dive possible into 'bassnectar' and reinvent it live while ripping into the past and flinging it into the future. its like the quintessential \"ok i am involved in every tiny aspect of this event\" so i just obsessssssssss over it\n\ni'm talking OBSESSIVE. COM. PULSIVE. so im basically just terrorizing my team for a year about this event. and ironically, lots goes right, lots goes 'wrong' and lots of stuff which goes not as planned ends up better than planned... this year our chocolate didnt show up and got melted, but we got a great new twist on it through the chocolate making team for next year\n\nbut im getting distracted.. bass center:\nyeah so i am like working nonstop hours with the lighting team, designing how to approach the room into the exact visual experience we want, going into the greeters, and the team who works the door, working on the lines, making the outside 'line' area blend into a larger kind of event carnival, maybe kind of like a Grateful Dead lot of the 1990's meets an ICP show, meets a free outdoor day party in Golden Gate Park... so we are working on every tiny element, plus we have musical guests who i am just RABID about\n\nand taking over Labor Day weekend [likely will not happen again] is unique because its 3 nights of intensive activity, and we are basically planning shenanigans from Friday Morning through to Sunday Morning...\n\nthen in terms of the music...for anyone who is like \"why dont you tour anymore\" ...those three nights are like fucking tour.\n\nwhen i used to tour I would have an A set and a B set, and i would alternate each night, back and forth. there would be some creative flexibility from set to set, but for the most part the 'tracklist' of A set was very similar. and the \"B\" set was very similar\n\nfor Bass Center, across three nights, I will conjur up 3 totally distinct sets which feel like the full throttle tour sets, which a totally unique and independant of each other, with all my favorite music, remixed into new versions, going NUTSO on the request line, and basically taking every request that comes in...with a twist :)\n\ni was just really excited about last year's event...beyond excited by it. and i am SO fucking amped to return to Hampton Coliseum again, that room CRUSHES... the floor is so massive, and we are making the stands wrap around so you can spend the whole night running in circles if you wish :)\n\nbut actually fuck all that, dont expect anything, just come join us and dive in deep :)",
      "YES INDEED :) last weekend in Chicago i had some of the bass network team nominate various people from LOVE HERE [which is a super dope FB group u should check out :] and we got together in a room, set up chairs in a circle and had deep talks, without phones [no pics, no autographs, etc] and just went around the room and talked about life. it was the kind of interaction I AM STARVING FOR: not only that its analog and in person and not digital, but also that it was really heartfelt and meaningful, and zero of that Artist-Fan vibe which feels so phony and dorky to me :) \n\nanyways, i'm hoping to catalyze more of that kind of thing in random tree forts at Electric Forest... or maybe out on a nature hike :)",
      "that was total chaos. i was losing my mind! I was so high on music I could'nt think or see straight, and all the facepaint was in my eyes so I literally couldnt see. They kept dragging me into the back, and i had to sit there listening to my head go \"WOMP WOMP WOMP WOMP WOMP\" waiting to go back on :)\n\nit was an elevator that kept triggering the system.",
      "i mean, any DIY events people want to produce amongst their friends: thats the beautiful anarchy of life... i hope its as raw and fun as the death metal and punk rock shows i used to organize in the public library basement when i was 16\n\n:)\n\nbut as for people actually trying to emulate, or brand, or immitate, ...i think people can do better than that. don't try and create a bassnectar or bass center event.. create a YOU event.\n\ndont grow your hair out and try and play music that sounds like bassnectar [grow your hair out and play music that sounds like YOU]..dont play rippoff 'tribute sets' for a band or music project that is still very active... make something new and fresh and meaningful\n\nagain, i dont mean that negatively, i am trying to encourage you that it will be more enjoyable and authentic and meaningful if you make it about YOU\n\neverything is reflective. so obviously if you are influenced by 'bassnectar' thats great.. i bet you are influenced by a lot of things and a lot of music... stir that all up in a pot and let that be YOU\n\nDIY art is where its at :) \n",
      "i suppose all my songs are love songs... in a way :)",
      "you're right!\ni have a copy which says \"Thoughts & IDeas By\" and it has one picture of him, and then i dound \"Ideas & Opinions By\" and its the same text, differnt cover :)",
      "well i do not experience any inner conflict - do you?\n\ni experience overwhelming awe... it's such an amazing experience to be a part of, and to contribute to. i am thankful i have the freedom of expression to broadcast my opinions and my imagination, and everyone else is free to do what they want too! :)\n\nwhen it comes to drugs [or ANYTHING dangerous] there is a difference between being a human individual and having the opinions/experiences i have, and being the brains of a massive concept-art event, and when it comes to that second role: i choose to make a much much much more general statement in the direction of health and safety: i'd rather err on the side of safety and caution then see anyone get hurt. so no judgements, and no negativity, just warm loving hope that everyone will treasure their bodies, be grateful for life, make the most of every moment, and be kind to others :) ",
      "thank you!\n\ni had the craziest fever that night, i was so dizzy i felt like i was floating! i literally had to keep checking to make sure i had not fallen down. A wise man would have probably just stopped headbanging but I was excited to be in Sweden for my first time, after growing up on so much Swedish Death Metal ;)",
      "yah im literally wrapping up this new tune with Jantsen right now, and need to get back to work, but suddenly i'm a Chatty Cathy",
      "yah i don't really party :) but i love this art project. I'm glad you liked the gun violence segment, that was actually a huge team effort, trying to dream up how to send out love & support, without interrupting the trance... i just think those kids are so brave and amazing!!!! ",
      "THIS IS SUCH A WONDERFUL QUESTION~!!!!!!\n\nok, so first off, THIS WAS AN ERA! during that era it made complete sense to do everything for free. Nobody got paid, nobody charged anything. we all worked constantly and it was a labor of love. The ones who REALLLLY should have been paid were the folks who owned the sound systems, and lugged them around the jjungle and the beach and the forest and set them up and ran them all night\n\ni think you need a possee to do this, its not a one man show, and honestly \"who is the dj\" is not as important as having like 25-50 friends who are dedicated.\n\nyou need a sound system, you need to set it up somewhere that it wont bother anyone, you need a team to park cars safely, you need all kinds of crew, and one of the things i never noticed back then was how much danger we were often in, and *NOW* its like this huge liability.\n\nlike if i broke into some private land, drove in 10 miles deep, set up a sound system, tweeted the GPS, and threw a massive free party on a full moon outdoors i would be arrested!!!! hahaha\n\noh dear\n\nanyhow, man...start with a house party and build with a team :)",
      "I GIVE NO FUCKS ABOUT A TYPO!!! :)",
      "hey dude :) thank you!\nunfinished miusical ideas? TONS\non my PC i have enough to make several albums, but its just too messy to finish anything... its like wandering through an old photo album or getting lunch with a best friend you havent seen in years, its overwhelming\n\ntechnology: yes, god bless its heart\n\nLoco Ono: that's strange, because i drop one of 4 versions pretty often. the original is very noisy and bezerk, i collaborated with Stylust Beats on a heavy lower octave version which i play alot, and JCO made a groovy version i just played last weekend :)\n\nalmost every track i play is subkect to heavy sampling though, so i love to sample the vocals from one track, or the instrumental from another, or the sound effects from another, etc\n:)",

And i love Charleston as well, we had to end early last time due to that psycho storm, but we'll be back i promise :)\n\nas for your question: i don't pick favorites. of anything. it's like me asking you \"what was your favorite strawberry\" or \"what was your favorite breath of air\"?\n;)",
      "no but seriously HELLO dear Funkymunks!!! 15 years sounds like WAY TOO LONG of time to spend in a slump!!! Not that you asked advice, but if you would permit me to give you some unsolicited advice:\n\nif i were you, and i was in a slump for even 15 days, i would find at least one person, and seek guidance from them. it could be a family member, a school counsellor, a free phone therapy app [you could try TALK SPACE...its legit]  ....or just a normal every day talk therapist\n\ni am not referring to a PSYCHIATRIST... you dont need drugs or anything, you don't even necessarily have a problem, so its more of a life coach.\n\nmore of someone trusted who can be a confidant and who you can work with\n\nmake a list of the things bothering you, which you would want to change... maybe like a list of things you most want change or which bother you the most\n\nthen make a one-by-one plan about how to deal with each in turn\n\nthen work with that person as the plan evolves and time passes. don't take it on alone\n\ni have found that most challenges which feel insurmountable actually have a way of working out, if you engage them without panic and just behave with a slow and steady commitment to clearing them up :)\n\ni wish you all the best :)",

      "hmmmm..its all a blur lets see\n\ntechnically there was no HARD START to \"bassnectar\" it just gradually became a thing. so i was making music as \"Amorphous\" for a while... this was while i was in college, and obsessed with Psy Trance... so it was all created in Electronic Music class, using massive synths like an Emu which was the size of a wall, one of a kind machine, all sounds created from scratch... i recorded ***HOURS*** of this stuff on ADAT, converted to DAT, and was also sampling tons of Twighlight Zone on VHS and my vinyl collection, and working with synths and samplers, and i was still writing tons of death metal on guitar, and it was just very gradual\n\nso the songs as \"Amorphous\" were never released, but i brought like 100 CDs to Burningman in 1997 and passed them out for free...\n\n\"Ananda Enchanted\" is some sample loops, some sample CDs i was jsut cutting up and looping, my friend Ananda was chanting, i had some sound effects i made on a synth, and then i sampled the Shawshank Redemption\n\nNeedzasubwoofer was just again some old drum loops and some bassline loops, and C3P0 saying \"Sometimes i just cant understand human behavior\" and looping it while running it through tons of EFFECTS until it because that made warped synth in the drop...\n\ndude, i have no idea really which order they 'came out' and i dont even care..\n\nit was so raw and organic back then\n\ni can appreciate people who want to nerd out on Bassnectar Trivia, but you gotta be super careful, because this was literally YEARS AND YEARS of natural progression and evolution, it was SO different back then ...you can't really view the music scene of the late 1990's through the lens of 2017, it wont translate... it was diferent for so many reasons [like for example i made mixtapes, and put them on CD and DJ's told me \"dont write a tracklist because then youre using another artists name to promote your mix\" and then later other poeple would say \"if you dont write a tracklist you arent supporting the artists who you are mixing\" and then sometimes i would have the wrong godamn info, or forget, or mispell, or i would have tons of tracks called \"Track 01\" or millions of pieces of vinyl with a white label... and i would name it my own name.mp3\n\nand my world was so small then, im talking 10 years before Myspace? so like when i mixed Freakbeat for Beatfreaks [I THINK it was that one, dont quote me] i literally made like 50 copies maybe? and just gave them out for free. later the press would call it an album, but i never called it an album... i believe i accidentally fucked up the tracklist, and later someone POSTED tracks to Youtube, and they labelled a tipper track 'grampa slams' and...then later some wing nut online who was likely in diapers when i was working on the mixtape comes up with some totally uneccesary controversy that 'bassnectar stole tipper' or something just so asenine and absurd... when actually i was promoting tipper before any of my friends had heard of him, and was booking him for full moon parties and along with Si Begg and FreQ and Adam Freeland and all the UK artists back then, my whole mob of friends were all about repping and promoting their tracks, whenever i mixed a song by Tipper or FreQ back then it was big time homage, and it was like one of my ways of helping supprot artists. I was pushing to get them booked at our full mooons,on our stages at Burningman, and was just a rabid fan, so to have some kid misunderstand and then assume that there was some controversy, and develop a controversy out of their own ignorance and confusion:\n\nthat is the trouble with playing trivia with the past... just assume all the facts are covered in dust and there is a lot og goodness going on because back them it was like fuckin freestyle church 24-7\n\nwhere was i ? oh yea... with trivia, or with the past, dont forget the music scene PRE INTERNET was so different\n\neven the late nineties scene PRE SOCIAL MEDIA was sooo different, you can't really piece together the puzzles through the lens of 2017, it wont translate... im happy to help you try and figure it out, but it was all so raw and humble and basic - everyone was just messing around and experimenting and giving and sharing and exploring live and direct.\n\ngoing back and trying to mechanically understand life back then is a whirlwind...\n\ntheres a lot of beauty though, so hopefully you can enjoy it.\n",
      "there are so many different directions i want to go in life...so many different \"things\" i wanted to \"do\"...different careers, hobbies, etc.\nI went to school to essentially become a teacher (wanted to teach US History) and a guidance counsellor (wanted to help people, basically) and I never really thought of music as a career, more like an obsession.\nI am not only obsessed with music, but also with \"Community\"...bringing people together, interacting in meaningful ways, giving, exchanging, and contributing to culture...\n\ni'm not really sure what I would want with a \"career\"\n\n:)",

      "Bandaloopin, i don't want this to come off as a personal diss, only just a factual comment: \n\nin a room like that, the sound is going to sound different everywhere you go. if you go to the front, it will sound loud [maybe too loud, i reccomend earplugs] but clearer, you have signal bouncing off all of those huge posts, and all of the hanging video chandeliers, and that ceiling is INSANITY, im sure you coudlnt see it but it was like an ocean of pipes and weird reflective surfaces.\n\nmaking a room like that sound 'perfect' for 20,000 people is not possible, you can make it sound REALLLLLLY GOOOOOOD in lots of places, but its gonna phase out in others and whatever\n\nthat's one of the main reasons i switched up from 360, because trying to send signal in all directions from the center is acutally just physically impossible.\n\nbut i do want to call you out for sounding like a dick, that its 'unnacceptable for someone with so much money' blah blah\n\nyou are so out of line there, and it just makes you sound stupid.\n\nfirst off, if you saw how much money we spend on sound and production, its STAGGERING... its actually probably IMMORAL considering how many people need food and shelter, that we spend that much money on art so that you can have fun. you are privileged to lead a life where you get to go to things like that, but don't be so stupid to think it's a financial issue.\n\nyou obviously don't know me, but we spend *UNGODLY* amounts of money [and time and energy] on this stuff...\n\neven if there were some areas which sounded bad, this was literally the best that room could have sounded. its not an issue of brand name... like you wouldnt sound better with a F1 or Meyers rig or anything... its just a very complicated room\n\nand for the record it sounded like golden honey to me when i was out there :)",

Hence: \nEmail feedback@bassnectar.net\n\nIf it’s complaining in any way about my art I am here to tell you that nobody wants to hear it especially not me. I not only don’t care about anyone’s opinion - I actively deplore and reject it. That’s how I make art. It seems to have worked out alright, so i’m Gonna keep doing what I do. \n\nIt is nothing but crazy making when one troll angrily complains “he just recycles the same crap over and over” while another troll complains “I didn’t recognize anything and I wanted to hear X, Y and Z! I come to a Bassnectar show to hear Bassnectar songs”\n\nThere is no pleasing everyone and I’m not trying to. This is art and I’m gonna do what I want (and by the way I DEEPLY ENJOY doing it :) and I’m simply making it CRYSTAL CLEAR that I’m this community your negative energy is not welcome and you should take it elsewhere. \n\nGo waste your life talking about what you don’t like somewhere else. \n\nThe community I built is for focusing on what you love and reflecting it and radiating it. \n\nIronic that the phrase “you know we love it” has devolved into such a grotesque mistake of misguided trolls venting all their negative opinions. \n\nNow I don’t go to that group and I know there are a lot of awesome people who wish it was about celebrating what they love, not listening to some self righteous wook crap in everyone’s face about how HE has been to 36 shows and ONLY HE knows the real truth and blah blah blah. Those kind of people need to leave because they are the opposite of my vibe. \n\nBy the way when I write “you” I don’t mean that to you “zenmaster7” (haha these fuckin profile names”) I meant it to the trolls. \n\nThis shit is nearly\nImpossible to communicate about clearly and it seems people miss the point. \n\nThe point is find what you love and love it. Don’t find what you don’t love and sit around hating it.

      "basically yah, DJs down on the floor, lights up in the air, keep the room as dark as possible so peoples just close their eyes and let their bodies move.

      "sweet :) Freestyle sessions is like no other event for us [by design] where the vision is really about diminishing the 'watch a dj\" or \"see a show\" and more of an all-body-sensory-overload BATH of music and sound waves... completely unrestricted by genre or any kind of rule [even more free than normal ha]\n\nlast year i put together like 6 hours of music from old record collection favorites, old highlight tracks i used to play at full moon sunrise sets, tons of random B sides and weird rare grooves and alternate mixes, as well as a ton of new tracks from friends which i flipped into loops or edits or whatever... its really a chance to get experiemental, but also play music for how it sounds not how it looks :)",

For me, i am kind of partly into setting themes, but also...keeping it freestyle\n\nif i *HAD TO PREDICT* i would say i will probably play more heavy/deep dubstep on friday night [like tracks which i don't usually get to play because they arent as upfront and in your face...but more rich and deep...some stuff i've never got to play before too] and i'll throw in lots of slow motion heavy stuff, and yah just lots of throwbacks, but really quite heavy. maybe even dark.\n\nsaturday, which typically would probably be the most Wildstyle, will instead be more OLD SCHOOL... like 'what would i have played in the sideroom of a wharehouse at 4am in 1998' ...so legit YOU MAY HATE IT!!!\n\nall i can say is if you hate it:\n\n1. never come to another Freestyle Sessions again!!! ;)\n2. try closing your eyes, and just moving to the sound... just flowing with it... i do expect saturday night to dissapoint if someone just wants to thrash around and lose their face... but for me, it's probably the most special because its lots of super 'lost music' and throwbacks\n\n\n\n***SUNDAY: i themed it Wildstyle, cuz for all i know ill play all future bass recuts, and weird records i've never played before *OR* ill play 2 hours of breakbeat ***OR**** i will play gangster rap and glitch hop and 2006 era music..i truly do not know :)",
      "i love history! i am fascinated by it!!!!\nread A People's History of The United States by Howard Zinn\nwatch \"Untold History\" with Oliver Stone on Netflix\n\npay attention because so much has gone down and then been forgotten about and HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF :)\n\nas for being a time traveller, i would rather just be deeply awake and grateful in the moment :)",
      "ironically i realllly loooooooooved that... i planned it that way, and was giddy with delight about every second in those 30+ mins :)\n\nand obviously, im not offended by you saying that: its really touching that you love the music i create :)\n\nthanks for sharing :)",
      "Butter: i would communicate more directly, but it is VERY hard. social media is a fuckin nightmare, and its just nearly impossible to actually have rational discussions... thanks for lookin out :)",
      "OH YES :)",
      "oh yah! that Okee Full moon set was VERY SIMILAR to the vibe i'll play at Freestyle :)",
      "thanks bomlete :) appreciate the support :)))))",
      "also if you have time to read:\n\nSAPIENS\nPEOPLE's HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES\nTHE AGE OF SPRIRTUAL MACHINES\n\n:)",
      "thanks so much! it's really been an unbelievable amount of energy and time, but the reality is: it's all reflected back 100 times over, so everything feels immensely balanced!!!!!!",
      "the gateway drug :)",
      "ESAHH :) haha you made me do a double take because that was Mr Sandman by The Chordettes, not Enter Sandman by Metallica [which is honestly one of the songs which made me buy a guitar and start playing music! i've never remixed that one though] ... i love jacking up the reverb when she is like \"bring me a dream\"..... sets a really spacey tone for a set :)\n\nas for mixtapes: i would *LOVE* to make a really crazy mixtape and put it everywhere, i'm just not sure you can anymore. there is some team called Dubset which i hear is working on setting up infrastructure for it... and i've heard about mixcloud, but i dont think there is a universal platform yet ...i made a really sick on last halloween and then never did anything with iiiiiiiiiiiit wah wah wah",
      "well i would say a few things:\n\n1. i reccomend NOT trying to make it into a business. i mean, you *CAN* do that if you want, but i have no advice for that. but i reccomend, if you really feel \"i have a passion for music, i understand rythm, i want to learn how to make music to release this feeling inside of me, and to celebrate how it feels\" then by all means, i reccomend you do. but i also reccomend you keep it pure, let it just be as pure as picking up a guitar, and learning mary had a little lamb. you dont need to go join Santana and become gods gift to guitarists, you just wanna have fun on a fuckin Yukelele and make some passerby smile for a second\n\n2. so if that's your vibe, then i reccomend you start with a team, don't go it alone. When i kicked off i did so with 2 friends. now i had already had years of experience with bands [and honestly THAT is what taught me music, when i start i was unbearable. i sucked so bad. my drummer would constantly throw his stick at me and yell that i was not satanic enough to keep rythm!!!] and after i got really comfortable playing music with others, and holding rythm, i got really experiemental with guitars and FX pedals and a 4 track...\n\n3. then i went to school, i was in the Electronic Music Minor program in college, and i learned a ton of stuff, but when i started to build a studio, i didnt do it alone, i did it with friends.\n\nwe shared our gear, we shared tips and tricks, and we learned togetether\n\ndiving right into it:\n\nget Ableton\nlearn how to warp audio\npull in some of your favorite songs, warp them to tempo\nthen mess around with re-organizing their sequence, try customizing them\n\nthen maybe remix them\n\nstart slowly and have fun :)",
      "it actually makes sense, my fingers are exhausted form constant clicking\nalso i just saw i miseplled form/from and i am not about to stop and take the tie to go back and fix that sheeeeeet\n\nmmkay :)",
      "wake up! :)",
      "miss you too! trust i have plans to return :)\n\ni have to be honest i have zero problem staying motivated or inspired it feels like a gushing waterfall of honey in my brain and its just surging out of control like the ocean :)",
      "they really didn't give me a bunch of shit though :) i know the whole crew over there, we are all friends. literally, i just lost interest in playing there because as pretty as it looks, it just doesnt sound good. i didnt even want to go back the last year we did, but ended up doing it anyways [and it was awesome and fun!] but i was like... i really want to find another place to play. \n\nid love to go see Dave Chappelle at Red Rocks!!!! for bass music, i'd rather go elsehwere, prefereably INSIDE, or somewhere that is contained and weather proof :)))))",
      "no, this is long overdue, im just setting it straight, i'm explaining what's not ok with me. you just need to respect that. sorry if it doesnt sound nice, but i'm over all the whining and complaining and negativity, and i want to protect the 95% of amazing people's experiences. the trolling doesn't bother me cuz i don't read it. it bothers others, and im letting you know",
      "exactly",
      "Razor Glitch, whatever your name is: you are the exact type of person who i would rather not come to our shows. you are unkind, arrogant, and toxic. it would mean the world to me if you would never come again, and if you have friends who agree with you or act like you: please tell them i said to stay home too :) \n\nwe are not about your vibe. its like the ANTITHESIS of what i am about\n\nso for my art, and for me as an artist: i'm telling you please don't come to shows\n\nas a human: i am telling you your vibe is awful and rude. you can do better than this i am sure!\n\nif you were my friend i would tell you: find what you enjoy...\n\nit's clear you don't enjoy bassnectar: that's fine. just find what it is you DO enjoy... and just spend your time enjoying that!!!\n\ndon't hang out somewhere you are miserable and complain... that's crazy\n\njust go somewhere else... and enjoy your self",
      "hahaha seriously, either tell me your email or if you dont wanna post it, hit up chris at bass network and hell link us :)",
      "CYCLO!!! first of all, please do yourself a favor and run from rumors. treat rumors like The Tidal wave in some bad movie, where its zooming toward shore. What do all the people in New York City do when the big hollywood Tidal Wave is zooming at them? THEY TURN AND RUN! THEY FLEE!!!! SCREAMING!!!!! hahaha treat rumors like a Tidal Wave :)\n\nthat said, i am perfectly fine to play on a stage with little or no LED screen, it doesnt affect me other than i will not play any specific content [like the Zeigeist message, or How To Draw Mushrooms, or whatever]... so that's always a bit limiting. but i'm totally down with it.\n\ni honestly love playing with no lights, no video, no nothing, on the ground, with only the moon and the stars. my friend Steve [who invented the word Bassnectar] used to always write \"lights and lasers by the moon and the stars\" on our Full Moon fliers :)\n\none thing i will say though, is stages are ridiculous\n\nso if they are gonnna stick me on a massive barn, i just hope they fill it up with some cool multimedia art or something, becaue i hate playing on big massive stages, it feels pointless. id prefer a little pod or booth or TP, and i prefer to not be center of attention\n\nso when they DO put you on a big stage, you kind of feel the necessity to fill it up\n\nlike if you have paint in your hands, and someone hands you a big blank canvas you dont just walk away and order tacos :)",
      "yeah lots of sleep, binge netflix, drink hot tea, take it easy :)",
      "thanks Jake!\ni am making you a solemn promise that we will read every single note or letter sent to feedback@bassnectar.net and *IF* anything can be done about it, it WILL BE :) we want to improve always... we always push ourselves to go above and beyond, and we have consistently done so for 20 years, not out of obligation.\n\nbecause we are freakin NERDSSSSS for this stuff, and WE LOVE doing it.\n\nso we want to know!\n\nnow you may say \"hey i want you to play a 46 hour show\" or \"i want a show with free red wine on tap\" or \"you guys should personally give people a piggy back ride when they walk through the door\" and you simply may not get your wish. but i promise we will take it to heart *WAY MORE* than if it's written aloud.\n\nit's the negative venting which just sucks to read [not for me, cuz i dont read it - but for everyone]\n\ni also just think people will be happier if they chill out a little bit... enjoy more... stop over analyzing and complaining so much: it will just make you happier.\n\ni promise i'll keep coming up with rad music to share with you and reflecting everything i love as loudly and brightly as possible, and working with a huge team to produce environments of kindness and warm family vibes :)",
      "trust me, my music *IS* going to change over time\n\ngood looooord could you imagine if it 'didnt change' over twenty years? YAWN.\n\nanyways, i think the more interesting point brought up on this thread is that EVERYONE wants something different, and everyone has a different opinion.\n\nthat can work for some things but it doesn't work for art.\n\nyou don't go see a painter and tell them to stop using purple because you don't like purple.\n\nyou don't go to an artist's exhibit whose earlier work you loved, and complain that their new work sucks [unless you're just a dick] ...if you don't like the new art, just go somewhere else.\n\nas an artist...i *love* every second of every set i play, that's why i play it. i do not give a fuck if its a song i wrote, or a song someone else wrote or a sample of your neighbor's drunken dog singing an Elvis song - that's the fun of my art... i get to play whatever i want... and i don't care about anyone's opinion. i am not a wedding DJ. if you don't like the music, god bless you: go elsewhere.\n\nbut i will always change.\nlife will always change.\nyou will always change.\n\nthe last godamn thing i wanna do is only play music from 2007. fuck you if you want me to do that.\n\nlike i said it's impossible to please everyone. its a social scientific fact that the average of 3% of any population will dislike the social function they attend.\n\nwhen everyone something different, i just have zero interest in trying to chase around their conflicting opinions: blah. that would be a terrible life.\n\ni would actually rather be a wedding dj in that case.\n\nso anyways, thanks for understanding: i am gonna play whatever i want. if you don't like it, by all means go elsewhere.\n\nbut... sorry i hope this doesn't sound arrogant: people obviously like it :)\n\nwe have 20,000 people flip out in musical bliss i don't care how many people online want to whine, just don't whine to me :)\n\n\n",
      "wow! 07???? happy ten year anniversary!!! thannk you :)",
      "thanks a lot! i really don't want/need any kind of credit, it literally is just absolutely not about me or any human, my hope is that it can just be a big \"thing\" and let everyone enjoy co-creating and expanding and reflecting :)",
      "can't be everywhere at once :) there will be many more fun times in the future :)",
      "yah that's awful!\n\nanyone passing out anywhere is awful, i think we have all seen awful things happen at shows, events, sporting events, parties, whatever. \n\nwe could not be clearer in our messaging how deeply we care about everyone's health and safety so do not for a second insuinuate that we dont work OVERDRIVE to care for everyone and promote a community of care :)\n\nand as feetswoop said below \"people passing out from taking too many drugs\" is definitely not our fault, so why would you complain as if it was?\n\nobviously i have said clearly \"PLEASE DO NOT DO DRUGS\" :)\n\nits way more fun :)\n\n\nok, im gonna stop writing now, its frustrating how people refuse to read words and instead just type nonsense, but that's why i don't frequent social media\n\nthe key message here is: find what you enjoy\n\nif you dont enjoy our art or my music, please leave and go elsewhere\n\ni truly do not want your feedback on my art",

Your feedback is neither important, nor relevant, nor requested for what music a dj is gonna play in her or his set, and your feedback IS NOT WELCOME OR REQUESTED at an art gallery... \n\n***the artist isnt sitting around hoping you will tell her or him if they should have used more purple, or if the lighting sucks. \n\ndoes this make sense? i really hope so, cuz its fucking BASIC.\n\nthe last thing an artist wants to do is hear that you wish they would have used more purple. ...tha fuck outa here..\n\n3. To repeat, i am not dismissing a legitimate concern [like a fucked up wait in a line or something] as trolling. That is valid and its totally valid to want to improve that. But to fix it, you simply need to email us directly if what you want is a SOLUTION. if what you want is to VENT, i am telling you that is hella annoying, and nobody wants to read your yelp review on life. \n\n4.

Also, thank you for expressing this, I resonate with how you are dealing with this baffling and difficult experience. \n\nSinisterEcho: that seems like less of a question and more of a release, like when im screaming at the sky, just to let it out? Obviously it is extremely painful to lose any friend or family member, much less a best friend.\n\nIt has happened in my life several times, and each time I allow myself to feel the pain and the sadness, and to experience that as a totally valid sensation, not bury it or push it away, but allow myself to feel the pain. But also, I focus on the bonds that were created and what came from that, I give thanks for the other friends who i met through that person, and what i learned with them and what we shared. I take many walks down memory lane and relive moments we shared and again i give thanks for what we shared, and pay respects and sink deeper into thankfulness and gratitude for our priceless experiences.\n\nthen i remind myself that all of that still exists, and i can circulate through my life and my future and in a sense that friendship can live on forever as a source of inspiration for how i live my life\n\nalso...anytime we lose anyone: it is a reminder of how precious and tender and ephemeral life is. Each and every time it is a reminder that you are a one of a kind, once in a life time miracle, and every single fleeting second is a priceless blessing... it makes life all the more worth living, and it inspires me to make the MOST of every possible second :)\n\nmuch love to both of you!\nL",

Sometimes when writing the history of UCB< or the times at SNL were fun, because they reminded me of all those stories, and I would start laughing thinking of all the ridiculous people I surrounded myself with. I was just texting with Fred Armisen, and telling him that i wrote nice things about him int he book, and he was very touched, and then I reminded him that his lawyers made me do it, and I said \"His lawyers will sue you if you don't write nice things about him in your book.\" ",

Theater in Chicago, and was one of my first, you know, patrons and teachers. And I studied with her and Del Close, and learned how to improvise, and then I basically was supported by and encouraged by all the great and talented people I got to improvise with.\n\nI try not to think about that, because it feels overwhelming. And I just try to do my thing, and it's really really nice to hear you say that, and I *thank you*, but that is the kind of thing that will give me night terrors if I allow it. ",

Kathleen Turner came in and read sentences from some of my darker periods. Carol Burnett joined me in the booth for a minute, as did Seth Meyers, Mike Schur, and my parents. And Lady Gaga was also there, but she also didn't say anything!",

And it's one of the first times you get to see the female be a heroine, versus a damsel in distress. She kicks ass, which is always a rarity in the industry. In sci-fi films, it's uncommon for the woman to be the badass. But the Lara Croft movies, Aliens... the fact you can count it is a problem versus all the action films where the heroes are always men.

They are very nice, of course, but they make you do things you don't think you are capable of doing. They challenge you.

I make a very fun cauliflower crust pizza... that's always really interesting. And salmon, my go-to dish, a little grilled BBQ salmon... one-pot meals are kinda my specialty, because that's lazy cooking and I'm awesome at that.\n\nAnd the worst meal I made may have been... I'll have to think about it... an avocado soup once, and it didn't turn out.\n\nYup, that's exactly what happened! Thumbs down. ",

      "Favorite ride at Disney? *Ooooh!*\n\nLet me think about this. I guess Splash Mountain? Because it has like, every element. It's fun, you get to fall in water, there's a drop and a fun musical aspect to it. \n\nBut there's something about the Peter Pan ride that i think is always magical. ",
      "My favorite movie... is not necessarily the best movie ever made. But the movie I love and have loved since I can remember is PRETTY WOMAN. It genuinely makes me happy.\n\nAnd my advice for actors: do it because you love it. Don't do it because you want to be famous. And enjoy the ride, because there is no end. ",
      "That wedding dress may be one of my favorites, but the whole thing weighed 30 pounds. And once you put on the head-piece you couldn't take it off, so someone had to help me hold my head up during those scenes. So the most uncomfortable outfit I've ever worn in my entire life... was also the most striking, for sure. ",

I sing it with so much gravitas... that no one can tell. Or I mumble it.\n\nThere's like a show where you had to finish every line of the lyrics? I'd fail that show.

I'll probably just be releasing singles (possibly EPs) going forward - I really don't think the album format is the most efficient or intelligent way for me to distribute my music anymore.  I highly doubt that I would sign with another label.  I guess I might be open to a distribution deal, but... we'll see.

Also, I'll choose a song for the medley if I think it will sound particularly funny as a polka, or if there is an opportunity in the lyrics for me to add sound effects or some other kind of gag.  Once I have a dozen or so songs approved, I'll just play those songs on the accordion and find a comfortable key for me to sing them in, and then see which order seems to flow the best.  Then I'll do a demo and arrange all the horn charts, and then the band and I will go into the studio and polka down with our bad selves!\n\nSorry to say, I'm not sure if there will be another recorded polka medley after the one on the new album.  They are a lot of work to put together (mostly for my manager, who has to deal with stacks of paperwork each time).  But I think the polka medley will always be a part of the live show, so maybe it will just continue to evolve over time.  This is all conjecture, of course... I have NO IDEA what I'm doing next.",

The \"You're Pitiful\" video would have been a direct parody of the \"You're Beautiful\" video - and part of me is actually glad I didn't have to do that one because I would have had to take my shirt off (as James Blunt did), and I didn't want to have to work out in a gym for 2 months to prevent the world from being grossed out by my less than stellar physique.

Meanwhile, my friend Chris Hardwick asked me to come up with a show for his YouTube Nerdist channel, and I thought - hey!  I can just do my stupid interviews THERE!

But I'm a *man*, and a man eats a Pop Tart raw, alright? And you nibble the non-frosting portion first, *like a man*, and then you slowly do different sized bites. You might do one bite, take a look at it, see what your teeth map looks like. \n\nBut most importantly, there's two, so you can experiment.

It's also a tactical thing, as a writer, you can establish a point of view but the \"inside voice\" can have the opposing point of view.

Marc Maron complaining is engaging; me complaining...believe me, when I first started stand up, I tried all different styles and ended up going back to what I initially started at. The cursing thing, my joke is whenever someone says, \"Why are you a clean comedian?\", I say, “Because Jesus told me.\" Again, there's no calculation behind the style of stand up that I do or Aziz does.

Therefore, they're talking to people, so people feel like there is an accessibility there. \n\nThat being said, yeah there's been plenty of weird and peculiar things. There's probably not a day that doesn't pass where someone doesn't come up to me and say, \"Hot pockets!\" thinking that that will be the highlight of my day, or that maybe they're the first person to do it.

      "I grew up watching Carroll Burnett, Lily Tomlin, and reruns of Lucy.  I think society is way more accepting of females being stand ups than when I started over 100 years ago.  Being awkward on stage is a benefit - people respond to vulnerability.  As Gladwell said, \"10,000 hours\"",
      "Thank you! First of all, u/ajchann123, you have a terrific taste in comedians! I would say that comedians often get way too much credit or criticism about the type of stand up they're going to do anyway. \n\nI'm considered a \"clean comedian\" or \"family friendly comedian,\" but that's just how it comes out. There's no incredible calculation behind being clean or family friendly; comedians talk about what they can get away with. Chris Rock or Lewis Black are just gonna do the type of comedy that they're going to do. If you know them, it makes sense what type of comedy that they're doing. I'm always hesitant to be identified as a clean comedian because all comedians, whether they be clean, female or African American or transgender, the only adjective they want is to be funny. \n\nI sometimes I feel as though \"clean\" is this asterisk that kind of disqualifies some of my success. People are not coming to see me do stand up because I don't curse. Hopefully they're coming because it's funny. We don't live in a society where cursing is that pervasive, where me not cursing is someone anomaly, *but* I have been asked that before but it's not some calculation. By the way, I do believe comedians don't have to please a large audience.  \n\nWhen I started stand up in the early 1800s, the task was to make people laugh. People that don't like you or people that you don't have in common, you're supposed to make everyone laugh. That's not to say that you're supposed to appeal to everyone but the premise was not to just appeal to a certain group of people; you're supposed to be funny for a lot people. The idea is the make the whole room laugh, you're never going to get the whole room, but even if people look at you and don't like you, the material should be strong enough to make them laugh. \n\nAnyway my point is, I'm a great guy. \n",
      "I think I'm very mindful of when people come to one of my shows, that I want them leaving with the thought that not only they enjoyed the show, but that they're gonna want to come back, when I come back in like two years or whatever. And part of that is, with stand-up comedy, there's this unspoken agreement that you're gonna have new material. \n\nSo part of that is new, meaning it isn't in a special, but the complaint? Probably that I'm too sexy. That it's visually too distracting from the stand up, because often I'm just wearing boy shorts, and nothing else. I don't know, I don't know if there's a complaint. I think I space it out where I won't go back to a market unless I have at least 80% new material. ",
      "I don't know if I can specify one exactly.

Phyllis Diller I remember vividly as a kid really, getting a kick out of that self-effacing approach. Jonathan Winters and Carol Burnett had a big impact on me too. ",

My father in law, who is a brilliant man, does a lot of puns. I guess it's whoever delivers it. Puns, in a way, should be punishable by death.

We get some help here and there. \n\nThere are subjects that I hope to figure out how to talk about. You know, different topics take time for me to figure out an angle into it. Whether it be something really dark, like on my last special I had a bunch of jokes about cancer, obviously not about someone having cancer, but about the shared human experience that we all have, it's touched everyone's life. So figuring out a way for some of these dark heavy topics to bring about humor and light surrounding them, if that makes sense? Because I certainly don't want my comedy to make anyone feel bad but I also do enjoy the challenge of making something humorous.

There are plenty of times where when debating some of the episode ideas, I would be dismissive of ideas that seemed too pedestrian or typical television shows, so last season we would do an episode like the Bible Story or Wonderful, which was the season finale, and I think that season 2 is much closer to those two episodes than the other episodes.

Our main goal with Hot Ones is for the guest to have fun and feel like they can be free and loose, so it’s important to me for them to know that we went the extra mile to understand what they’re all about, and ask about the shit that other people might leave on the cutting room floor.

We cut parts out of the video when he talked about how much he enjoys the show because then people would complain that WE'RE being haughty and too proud.

I was working a copywriter job in a cubicle in Chicago but I'd freelance on the side for some extra money and because I needed a creative outlet. That led to freelancing for Complex, which led to meeting Chris Schonberger (EIC at First We Feast), which led to this ridiculous show, which led to me answering your question here. \n\nAs far as I can tell, Fox Sports Australia washed \"Burning Questions\" from the world. Maybe those ding dongs are still doing it but they've definitely stopped putting it on YouTube. S/o Bert Kreischer btw!\n\nI've never spoken to Joe. I don't get the impression that he does much press and he told Bert he wouldn't do Hot Ones on the JRE. But we'd kill to have him on the show if he changed his mind.

I remember studying note cards and being nervous as hell for, like, a five minute video interview with 2 Chainz lol. Anyway, to get back on track... Complex liked the video pieces enough to offer me a full time job so I quit my gig in Chicago, sold my shit and moved to NYC 30 days later.\n\nJinx smells like cigar guts and Old Spice. \n\nAnd, it took some digging but here's my first ever video interview!

Then there's a whole other category of episodes I appreciate because of the ground they cover. \n\nBut, my favorite thing about Hot Ones is that it seems like the fans all have their own favorites, for their own reasons. My favorite episodes are the ones no on can agree on, where one comment is \"Worst guest ever!\" and the next is \"GOAT episode!\" That's how I know we've hit the right Hot Ones notes.",

Happy Thanksgiving dudes!",
      "It kind of came about organically but the short answer is that we were looking for a way to create a celebrity interview show that didn’t suck, and we knew it needed some subversive element to get guests out of their PR-driven holding pattern. I grew up idolizing people like Howard Stern and Letterman, and eating hot-ass salsa with my dad. Chris Schonberger grew up watching these weird British shows where they did offbeat celeb interviews (hence our seemingly random obsession with Alexa Chung), and he was really into hot sauces. So when he brought me the idea it all sort of clicked. \n\nThe idea definitely evolved a lot once we started doing it though. The fans have been a big part of that and we always pay attention to the guests people want to see, and what fans like about the structure of the show.\n\nWe were actually just talking about this the other day in the office and found the first email pitching the show to our company. Here it is—the funniest part to me is that Chris thought he could host it! LOL.\n\n*Concept: To shake up the tired Q&A format, we put the talent in the hot seat: They have to answer our most probing questions while also eating incredibly hot wings. Tony Hawk eats at a lot of high-end restaurants around the world and is also involved in the San Diego restaurant scene, so we'd like to interview him about his culinary travels while he battles with the wings.\nWe could get Sean Evans to host. Or I can.\n\nLive date: TBD *",

But to best answer your question, these interviews can oftentimes last an hour-plus so they're just kind of sitting under TV lights drying out? I don't really know. Feel like there's plenty of sauce from my POV tho haha.",

Figured you guys would be more excited for new episodes than to try a hot sauce.\n\nOn the reaction front people say the same thing every season, that the other seasons were hotter.

      "I've been trying. I've been looking for them. I don't think our orbit is where we can see them yet, but we will be. I'm keeping my eye out for it and will certainly share them with everyone when I see it. ",
      "It smells more like burnt metal ",
      "Occasionally...",
      "After my first flight, I had a tendency to want to that. I definitely tried to float out of bed to go to the bathroom.",
      "Generally it has to do with the toilet. Recently I had to clean up a gallon-sized ball of urine mixed with acid. ",
      "You'd have to ask my brother",
      "A salad. ",
      "A giant leap is really a number of small manageable steps. Take one at a time.",
      "I think a lot of people think that because we give the appearance that this is easy that it is easy. I don't think people have an appreciation for the work that it takes to pull these missions off, like humans living on the space station continuously for 15 years. It is a huge army of hard working people to make it happen.",
      "Straight outta space. I want to see that movie, that's what's up. ",
      "I think SpaceX and BlueOrigin and other private companies are doing great work. \n\nI don't know why NASA doesn't focus on reusability. It seems SpaceX has proven it's possible.",
      "I don't feel any differences now. Took about 8 months to feel back to normal. I rarely have a dream about space, unless I'm in space.",
      "I am 250 miles above the Earth, and I'm going very fast.",
      "I am talking to you live, but someone else is typing this in. \n\nDepends on your definition of soon. If we wanted to devote the appropriate resources to go to Mars, we could do it. ",
      "We have a lot of juices and coffee and tea. And something that's similar to Kool-Aid.\n\nDo I miss any food/snacks? from space? no.",
      "Good question. Yeah, there are a lot of changes that happen. Some of them you can't see, cause it's your eyes! Probably too many changes to go into detail here. I think my rehab plan is the same as if I were here for 6 months, but I'm not positive. ",
      "Well, I haven't been in building 9 since February. But we have a new Cygnus cargo craft here. \n\nI read Endurance: Shakleton's Incredible Voyage on my last flight, and I read it again during this flight. So, I do think of those men when I am on the space station. Thanks, Destin. I am getting smarter every day I am here. ",
      "That's a tough question. The worst time was when my sister-in-law was shot, and I was halfway through a six month flight.",
      "I think you definitely have got something there. And that would make a great experiment. The Japanese had some fish they were experimenting on at various levels of gravity below 1g. ",
      "I read, write and do arithmetic like a Kindergartner (just kidding). But I do read, take photos of the Earth and play with my food. ",
      "I think a lot of those flat earthers don't believe the earth is flat.  The risk is when you discount something that is clearly fact, it causes people to question other scientific facts and that can be dangerous.",
      "1. My muscles and joints are a whole lot better up here than with gravity. It's almost like you are in a bed rest. There is no pressure or pain. I do stretch before I exercise because my muscles aren't stretched out, they are somewhat dormant. \n2. It would be a disaster to have something powder like that. Depending on how much it was, we would possibly consider shutting down the ventilation to stop it from spreading. For salt, we actually use liquid salt that we put on our food. ",
      "It's all about money. Money can solve a lot of problems, including this one.",
      "The first thing I will eat will probably be a piece of fruit (or a cucumber) the Russian nurse hands me as soon as I am pulled out of the space capsule and begin initial health checks.  ",
      "1. It would definitely depend on the mission. If it was to the moon or Mars, yeah I would do it. \n2. I am not a great sleeper. I don't think I have ever slept 8 hours straight in the last 20 years. I wind up waking up a couple of times. My dreams are sometimes space dreams and sometimes Earth dreams. And they are crazy. ",
      "In a perfect world, the Moon is a great place to learn and practice for going to Mars. But with limited funding, maybe directly to Mars is a better choice.",
      "Smells vary depending on what segment you are in. Sometimes it has an antiseptic smell. Sometimes it has an odor that smells like garbage. But the smell of space when you open the hatch smells like burning metal to me. ",
      "My belief in our mission. And the fact that I couldn't come home, so I had no choice.",
      "The acid is added to the urine so the urine doesn't damage the machinery that moves it through the system. It keeps it from clogging up the system. ",
      "I think it will be a reality for some in a few years.  I'm not sure about for the masses.  I hope it develops along the same timeline as aviation did.",
      "1. We use Greenwich Mean Time and we get up at 6 in the morning and go to sleep at 10 at night.\n2. It's really light up here! On Earth, it weighs about 200 pounds.\n3. It's not the easiest thing, but we do have a good way to communicate. I do suspect there will be an adjustment period when I get back.",
      "I never felt like I was completely adapted to life in space, but the transition to space to me is easier than the transition back.",
      "You seem to have the minimum qualifications. NASA likes people who have done well in their jobs, but they also like people who have other skills like leadership, teamwork, ability to work with your hands.  Find ways to get more of those skills if you don't already have them.",
      "Yes, all the time. They are great friends. But sometimes it seems like we're working on two different space stations, because there are two halves.",
      "I'd like to have some involvement and continue to work towards people going to Mars.\nThe advice I would give myself on day 1 would be pack lighter!",
      "Number 1: Tibet and the small lakes North of the Himalayas \nNumber 2: Everywhere else.",
      "I have not, but I will take a look soon. \n\nYes, I would go to Mars on the BFR, assuming it works.",
      "I don't feel alone or afraid. I was up here for 6 weeks as the only American on the U.S. side of the space station and I was fine. I have been afraid when the ground has called and privatized the audio generally meaning something bad has happened. So I have been a little afraid. ",
      "I think there are places where government are more capable and others where private industry will excel.  I think there are ways they can compliment each other.",
      "I didn't have a ham radio license, so the ham radio guy wouldn't let me use the radio.",
      "We try to avoid changing our sleep schedule and we have window covers that can make the space station dark.  Generally at the end of the working day, I would dim the lights before turning them off.  Now we have lights that can be adjusted for the purpose of helping with the circadian rhythm.",
      "Absolutely not. I would need the return ticket. Would you?",
      "You might be surprised, but it's not Space Oddity. Probably Modern Love.",
      "I don't know, it can be anything we want it to be.  It's up to us.",
      "I just sneezed twice coming into my crew quarters. And I do what I do on Earth and cover my mouth with my hand. If I didn't do that, it's possible the sneeze could be found floating in another module. I generally don't sneeze into open air on Earth or here in space. ",
      "I was a test pilot in the Navy and I had a good reputation.  But more than that I think there is a lot of luck and timing involved.",
      "The fluid in your body gets redistributed to your head, so you have this congested feeling for a year.",
      "We have a vacuum we use to clean the filters, and then we have something similar to a wet wipe that we use to clean everything else.",
      "You definitely have a different perspective when you've spent time in space, and some people refer to this as the orbital perspective: a sense of being more empathetic to the environment and the human condition.",
      "About an hour and a half a day",
      "Over 400 different experiments in all different scientific disciplines.",
      "1. It absolutely takes longer to do things when you can't put anything down.\n2. I would like the next president to support a budget that allows us to accomplish the mission that we are asked to perform, whatever that mission may be. \n3. I talk to my brother and daughters every few days. ",
      "I never saw anything that I couldn't explain later after looking at it for a while. ",
      "I have never been a participant in an argument. I have witnessed some. Generally it involves work. ",
      "Absolutely.  Looking down at the planet, you don't see political borders. You see one planet of which we all belong to. You see the fragility of our atmosphere that is everything protecting our beautiful Earth. Thanks for your questions! ",
      "No. In space, no one can hear you scream.",
      "Apollo 13 and The Martian. I used to watch the old school Star Trek.",
      "Pretty good. I'm chatting with you from space now. So, I'd say good enough. It's like dial-up, but sometimes it works better than other times. ",
      "Any nervousness, if you want to call it that, for me, was always associated with the bad stuff that can happen to the people you care about on Earth. ",
      "Never bored. too much to do.",
      "I really enjoyed the Martian. I was able to watch it here aboard the space station. I've flown the space shuttle a couple of times, so I would want to fly to Mars. That would be something new and exciting, and is the next step in our journey of space exploration. ",
      "Took me about 8 months to feel completely back to normal. The one thing I had to learn again was how to control my daily schedule and decide what I was going to do.",
      "We are studying cardiovascular effects of long-term space travel. Much of the research we are doing here on the space station looks at the responses of our bodies in microgravity. \n\nIt seems blood pressure is lower because it doesn't have to fight against gravity. ",
      "That you get to space by launching straight up. You get to space by going really fast and getting out of the atmosphere, which causes us to fly a much lower trajectory than you might think.",
      "The first two minutes and ten seconds, riding on the solid rocket motors.",
      "Yes it hits it all the time",
      "My favorite spot on Earth to see from space is probably the Bahamas. The brilliant and varied colors of the blue water and contrast from here is pretty spectacular. \n\nIt was in the middle of my night. I couldn't watch it right away, but I read about it online. I was very impressed and excited for all of us. ",
      "It's sad that most of the news that comes from Earth is bad news.  When I got back, everything looked better.  Earth has a lot to offer.",
      "I would have it less than earth's gravity, but I would live mostly in gravity because things are easier to do. I would visit the zero gravity part for fun.",
      "I watched the movie Gravity not long after I arrived back in last March. I thought it was a cool movie to watch here aboard the space station that is also the setting of Gravity. ",
      "The challenge of living here. It's not easy and I have always liked to do things that are hard. ",
      "Sussudio",
      "I think we should make a real, honest effort to go to Mars.",
      "I wasn't until I got to space and binge watched the whole series twice.",
      "https://youtu.be/cQC4hIsn4Ow\n\nWhat happens when you cry in space? Space gorilla explains! What else do you want to know about? Ask me Anything now!",
      "Bring less stuff.",
      "You need to choose a field to work in that is qualifying first. Some kind of engineering, math, science, medicine, military pilot, etc. Then, you need to do well at whatever you are doing. Also, try to develop other skills beyond your work. ",
      "My dream would be for the government to allow NASA to continue on a single course and not change plans every 4-8 years. Long term, I think we should have an outpost on Mars and other places in the solar system.",
      "Caitlin, No absolutely not. But I guess it depends on your home! It is good enough, but not as good.\nErin, No, we are not much closer. \nYou, Possibly...",
      "The Godfather",
      "My retirement does not consist of golf, unfortunately. I'm busier now than I've ever been.",
      "Our spacesuit when we are spacewalking has about 4psi above the outside pressure, so when you are in it, it's generally the same stiffness as when you are doing a spacewalk. \nWhen I look at the clouds over the Earth, and I know how high clouds are, I get a sense we are really, really far above those clouds. So, it does look like we are very high. I wouldn't call it scary, but I am aware I am in space. A spacewalk requires an incredible amount of mental concentration, so it's not something I think of when I am spacewalking. ",
      "Surreal. Crazy. Type two kind of fun. Fun when it's done.",
      "There's a lot of space junk up there, but you don't see it. There are initiatives to clean it, but that will be a challenge.",
      "I would say 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.",
      "To the low earth orbit, it will be private companies—non-government companies. I hope the SLS program continues. NASA's often challenged when we change administrations, they sometimes change our plans.\n\nEnjoy the book!",
      "I don't make sandwiches, I only eat them. Anything from a New York deli.",
      "A couple hours every evening, and one day on the weekend. I liked taking pictures of the Earth. It's very beautiful.",
      "Think of your genes as an orchestra and my brother's genes as the exact same orchestra.  Change in expression is the orchestras playing a slightly different tune.",
      "Seems logical, I guess.",
      "Yes I did and I would like to go back. It's a great museum that tells a really interesting story.",
      "I don't know a whole lot about it. It looks really cool and I'm sure it's well designed, so yes.",
      "1. This mission isn't easy. So I think when I complete this mission, it will be up there, definitely. \n2. Sleeping, taking pictures of the Earth, and getting to the end of a satisfying day of work\n3. It is a little bit surreal to know that you are in your own little spaceship and a few inches from you is instant death.\n",
      "I love Legos! But I haven't played with toys in a long time. ",
      "My genes are the same, what changed was gene expression.  I'm not familiar with that movie. ",
      "Having a good understanding of the size of the universe, I find it hard to believe there's not life out there. Having said that, I don't think the aliens stopped visiting Earth once everyone got a camera in their pocket.",
      "Yes, and yes. Very good questions. A lot of similarities to military deployment.",
      "NASA has minimum qualifications you can find on a website. So, being in one of those fields would be necessary to be a NASA astronaut. And then doing well in that field.",
      "The granola with milk was my favorite.",
      "Absolutely, I will miss this place. But I am looking forward to returning home. I would love to visit Puerto Rico. I haven't been there in more than 25 years. ",
      "A lot of debris out there, but in space there's no medium for sound waves to travel.",
      "It's an eleven!",
      "I'm feeling much better, and we have great medical care. Our doctors were right there along with me, if I needed them. The worst part was the swelling in my legs. That was the most disturbing.",
      "Gravity is critical to our digestive system. Eventually, you sort of get used to it. ",
      "It seems like the inside of the space station has very good material condition. The outside looks a little aged. As far as maintaining it versus deorbiting it, it just depends what our priorities are. I think it would be great to keep it going forever, but of course everything has costs. ",
      "The frequency of space walks vary. I did three in the span of a couple of months. My previous flight, I was there for six months and didn't do any. And yeah, there's almost always something to fix.",
      "We have a resistive exercise machine that mimics weight very well. We have a treadmill and a stationary bicycle. And we exercise every day...well, I exercised six days a week.",
      "Part of our job is research, part is taking care of the space station to live and work up there.  It takes time.  I didn't have an incredible amount of spare time, but when I did, I wrote, I read.  When I go camping my space habits are very present - keep track of your stuff and your trash, don't lose anything, etc...",
      "Definitely would want to be from the future! Assuming it's a good future. \n\nI use a Nikon D4. Depending on what I am taking a picture of, the camera settings and lenses vary. ",
      "They did an incredible job taking care of us, looking over us, looking over the space station, which was their responsibility. Above and beyond? One of my flight directors, Mike Lammers, would often check in on Amiko, my fiance, while she was in mission control working. That wasn't part of his job, but I appreciated it greatly.",
      "It's a toss up between Orion the Hunter and the Big Dipper, because those are the only two I know.",
      "I stretched an inch and a half. And upon returning to Earth, I instantly scrunched back down to my normal height of 6 foot 7.",
      "Teamwork, technical competency, honesty.  Russian space food is different and it's great to have variety. ",
      "Well if you don't cover your sneeze-hole, something's going to travel for miles and miles and miles.",
      "We do have a 3D printer, but I haven't seen it. It is packed away and we haven't used it since I have been here. Hopefully we will use it soon!",
      "A really dark place with no pollution. I think we are on the cusp of some pretty exciting advances in space travel. The first dog I saw was the most unexpected thing.",
      "Telecommunications, GPS, microprocessors all come from technologies of space. ",
      "Oh yeah, we have a pretty obscured view of the night sky. We are moving pretty fast (17,500mph). We do not have a telescope we can look through, though. I have seen shooting stars, but not as many as you would think. ",
      "No. However, sometimes stars or even space junk as it passes through the horizon, the atmosphere can make it look suspicious.",
      "I did some research with rodents that was technically complicated, challenging and had implications for health benefits on Earth. ",
      "He's a friend of a friend, and it was great having him sing for us in space. \n\nI didn't have many other famous callers. Bryan Cranston and Vince Gilligan were two folks I talked to on this mission.",
      "The fact that it holds everything down.",
      "I think it's likely there is intelligent life in the universe.  Although I'm not a big believer in the idea aliens have visited Earth.  ",
      "Yes, generally a week to ten days. Works most of the time. There have been cases of people, though, carrying the cold virus to space.",
      "It would depend on why I was here. If there was a legitimate reason to stay here, I would do that. If staying here longer was just to stay longer, I would throw up my hands. ",
      "I was inspired by the book \"The Right Stuff\" by Tom Wolfe.  All kids are different and it's a challenge to find out what inspires each kid.",
      "No space sunscreen! Our windows are protective so you don't need sunscreen. \nI would want to have better radiation protection as we get further from the Earth. That is something we are working on.",
      "Thank you. Gabby is my sister-in-law. I will pass your kind words on to my brother, Mark, and her. But she is doing great.",
      "Never alone. Correct, I've never been lonely. I was up there, at one point, for six weeks with two cosmonauts, and it was absolutely fine.",
      "Physiological—radiation damage. \nPsychological—prolonged confinement.",
      "Probably this one day where we had incredible aurora completely around the space station. Seeing North and South Korea from space is pretty profound. Hurricane Patricia was pretty profound as well. ",
      "No, I never felt claustrophobic or anything. But you do feel detached from Earth and realize you're not coming back any time soon.",
      "https://instagram.com/p/Bd--lXbBduI/ ",
      "On the space shuttle, I was the pilot and then the commander. So a lot of responsibilities for operating the vehicle. On the Soyuz, I was more like the copilot to the copilot—a glorified passenger.",
      "That was Chris Hadfield",
      "You can notice the mass when you try to move or stop. ",
      "The way the story was relayed to me, he bounced off an antenna. And I don't believe a rescue would have been possible. As far as the diaper's concerned...",
      "It's exciting! Anytime we go to Mars it's a great day.",
      "I wrote down a lot of my dreams, and I have them in my book, which comes out tomorrow! Definitely vivid space dreams that I don't really have on Earth.",
      "I spend a lot of time doing public speaking, and I just wrote a book which was a lot of work. I hope, when it comes out tomorrow, people will like it. yes, I would consider all of those things.",
      "We work and exercise from when we get up until a couple of hours before we go to sleep. Our work involves research, maintenance, and taking care of the space vehicles. It is an honor to be up here.\n\nWe use Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).",
      "We are not much closer. The space station is at 250 miles, so they don't seem bigger. But without the atmosphere, they definitely are brighter.",
      "I hate to disappoint you, but not really. I lived on the space station for 159 days before. I knew that was a long time, and I knew this would be longer. ",
      "I never feel bored up here. There is always plenty to do, and not enough free time to do it. As for lonely, we have pretty good ways to stay connected with people in your life. I certainly miss my loved ones, but I never feel lonely. And connecting to people back on Earth on social media like this helps too! ",
      "Not much. I think his reaction to gravity on return was similar to what I experienced.",
      "Absolutely. There's a lot of opportunity out there, even if your country does not currently have a space program.",
      "Not. I flew A-ROUND it.  And if it was flat, wouldn't the edge be the most popular vacation destination.  ",
      "I think there is a place for government and industry for space flight.  There are ways they can compliment each other.",
      "Yes! It is easy. I won't be able to do that when I get home. ",
      "It was different, because it was over twice as long. But I think I was well prepared for it. But it was still a challenge.",
      "I am not familiar with that, but I will look into it.",
      "I would say that orbital perspective I talked about in one of the previous questions is what most astronauts experience.",
      "Jetlag. We train in a bunch of different countries, and, unlike when you're on vacation, you can't sleep in.",
      "No plans in the near future in Ohio. If I do have a public event, I'll post it on my website (www.scottkelly.com).  There are all types of jobs at NASA even for those without a science background.",
      "No. Most cases, I felt over-prepared.",
      "The whole thing is a big \"aw\" moment. Just absolutely incredible.",
      "It's still hard work, but we are a lot better at it. We have a better sense for what is required. ",
      "Earth.",
      "No. But the moon is made out of cheese.",
      "Science impacts our lives everyday because nearly everything we have is due to science.  My favorite project was the year in space mission.  I really liked working on an experiment that involved mice to help us learn how space affects the body.",
      "It takes a while. Everyone is different. Dizzy, tired, sore muscles. It's an individual case by case. I went through the adjustment period on my return to Earth after my last flight on the space station. I'll have to wait until I return again after this flight to see what my adjustment will be after a year. ",
      "No. Nor did I cry.",
      "Technically, that's possible. But we are often constrained by our budget, so I don't see that happening in the near future, if by near you mean in the next few years.",
      "The most challenging thing about being in space for a year is time. A year is a long time. ",
      "Because I thought being an astronaut would be exciting and challenging.  ",
      "About 8 months. Back to almost normal in about 2 months.",
      "No but I'm aware of who he is because we share a name.  We have never met.",
      "A banana.",
      "Thank you everyone for your questions! I enjoyed the discussion and am excited to keep helping others appreciate the importance of science. Thanks for joining!",
      "NASA has minimum qualifications you can find on a website. So, being in one of those fields would be necessary to be a NASA astronaut. And then doing well in that field.",
      "See my previous answer.",
      "I think we will continue to make new discoveries about our own solar system as well as the universe as we continue to explore and go beyond our boundaries. Space is a very big place. ",
      "Wow, a 5 in 1 question. To allow me to answer as many Qs from others, I'll answer one of these. 2) I read the zinnia is an edible flower, but I am lucky I don't need to eat it for my survival because I also read it is bitter in taste. But I did place a zinnia as a centerpiece at our dinner table one evening. "
