You beat me to it because I'm in London!\n\nLast year I learned that the more fun I have promoting after-school all-stars, the more fun you have watching and the more you get engaged. So it's my Trojan horse - I do ridiculous things and have a great time, but I get you to pay attention to something really close to my heart. This isn't a vanity project - I know the power of after-school programs in kids' lives and that's why I started After-School All-Stars more than 25 years ago. I've talked to teachers, police officers, parents, and most importantly, the kids themselves and I've never seen such unanimous agreement. But still, some politicians mess around with the funding because the kids don't have a high-paid lobbyist like all of the adults do and their parents are too busy working to fight - 70% of households include two working parents, so 70% of our kids lack the supervision and growth and love from 3-6pm that they deserve and need. Our biggest responsibility is to our kids but they are unquestionably the most underrepresented in our capitols so we end up spending lots of our money on the adults, on the present and the past, and not on our kids, the future. That's why I fly to Washington every time they talk about cutting the after-school funding to make sure they don't screw over the kids. But whatever you do, please don't call me a lobbyist.\n\nLast year, I also realized that you guys here at reddit are the most powerful ally I could have in my crusade for after-school programs. The fact is, I have quite a platform. I can talk about this in the 20 interviews I'm doing about Terminator today and post to Facebook and Twitter, but even I can't do this alone. And when I join forces with you guys, great things happen. Last year, we raised millions and millions of dollars and 1.1 million dollars with our Omaze campaign alone. This year, I want to do better. I will match you guys up to $500,000.\n\nI will do every fun and ridiculous thing I can do to elevate the issue. All you have to do is join me. All of you have something to give. If you can't spare the 10 dollars to donate, give your time - teach kids sports or technology, read with them, or just hang out and let them know you care. You can find our programs at www.afterschoolallstars.org or you can volunteer at whatever program is near you.\n\nIf you do have 10 dollars, enter and come to the premiere with me.

First of all, it was in Munich. I have always loved a good prank, and this one was one of my favorites. The guy was a little wild. We mostly pranked the guys who showed up huffing and puffing and acting tough. So this guy was already saying he was going to win the competition. I told him that the new trend in posing was sound effects. The higher your arms are, the higher the pitch of the scream. As you get lower, you drop your voice. I told him not to worry about the reaction, this was the big thing in America and England and Germany would catch up. By maybe the fourth scream, he was dragged off stage and thrown out the back door. There were no repercussions for him, except some embarrassment. \n\nAnother great one was the time we oiled up a tough guy who wanted to squat with us. He literally waited for me by the squat rack for 12 hours on two days until I came to squat. He knew I would be there at some point because I squatted that frequently. When I put on 135 to warm up, he called it chicken weight. Then as I gradually moved the weight up, to 225, 315, etc. he said we were doing it wrong and we were going to get worn out. When we got to 405, he finally said, now you're at my weight. I told him we planned to take photos and asked if he wanted to join us. Of course there was no camera. So he took off his shirt and we really oiled up his traps. Then we said we should keep working out until it was time for the photo. He only did a half rep (he was one of those guys who did twice the weight he should have and didn't do full reps), but when he came up, because of the oil, the weight was 2 inches lower. On his second rep, the weight slid completely off and we caught it so he wouldn't get hurt. I said, \"You should really warm up next time.\" After that, he never made fun of us for our warm-up, and he even joined in.\n\nI also pulled pranks on my best friends, like the time Franco had just arrived in America and I greeted him with a marijuana cookie. He was fresh off the plane and I wanted to be a little cautious so I only gave him half. I took him to my friends' apartment and they couldn't figure out why we spent an hour lying on their floor laughing. They only knew Franco's reputation as the strongest man in the world, so they were shocked. Franco had a great time but didn't know why. I finally told him a few days later.\n\nSo there's a short history of my bodybuilding pranks. Thanks again. I really had a great time.

When I was the chairman of the President's Council on Fitness, I traveled to every single state. I saw that kids had nowhere to go between 3 and 6, and the more I learned about it, the more I realized there was a serious problem. Gang violence, teen pregnancy, it all skyrockets in that time when kids are unsupervised.\n\nEvery dollar we spend on these programs saves us about 9 dollars down the line in prison costs and increased productivity. But still, we always need money. In California, I helped push Prop 49 which funds after-school programs, but mosts states don't have anything like that.\n\nKids don't have lobbyists working in the state capitols. Everyone else does, so they grab the money and then there is nothing for the kids. I have had to go to Washington to lobby to stop them from eliminating the billion dollars for this program several times. Imagine - just a billion dollars! So every time I hear Congress is cutting it, I head back and have meetings. I can't find an article right now, but I am sure someone can post. I've posted my op-eds on reddit, so maybe someone can find them.\n\nThere are 20 million kids who would be in an after-school program if they were available. I want to keep expanding to help as many kids as we can. Just to give you an idea, it takes about 7 dollars per kid per year. Last year, you guys helped me raise more than a million dollars. Do the math.\n\nI found Omaze, and I thought I have a tank, I have access to things that other people don't. I can use this to raise money. As passionate as I am about After-School All-Stars and programs in general, I know to some people it is boring. So I make it fun.

I answered something along these lines in r/politics. This is what I said:\n\nDespite my views on electoral reform, environmental policies and social issues, I am conservative.

I\u2019m not a \u201cNo Tax Pledge\u201d Republican, but I am a \u201cWe better make damn sure every dollar we collect is spent wisely\u201d Republican. And by the way, I\u2019d note that my environmental views are in line with the party\u2019s history - Nixon created the EPA, Reagan created CARB in CA and fought for the Montr\u00e9al Protocol to deal with the ozone as President, and Bush 41 dealt with acid rain. As for gerrymandering? I don\u2019t see how it is a partisan issue. Anyone who defends it, like the Michigan GOP in this case, must be forgetting that if they lose power, the other side will pull the same trick. I can even make an argument that every free-market loving Republican should support reform. If your ideas aren\u2019t good enough to win without a fixed \u201cmarket\u201d of voters, well, that\u2019s how a market works.

The environment was not always political. I also support huge infrastructure investment, which was never political. And both parties fought my redistricting reform and open primaries, so everybody disagrees with me there. And my views on education reform clash completely with most Democratic politicians I know. I think it's crazy that tenure kicks in after two years, making you a teacher for life, and I think too much money goes to the adults in the system instead of to the kids in the classrooms. \n\nBut generally, my politics confuse people because I think politicians should look at the best idea regardless of parties, and more and more people are locked into ideological corners.

I\u2019m worried about government spending beyond its means, I\u2019m worried about our debt, I\u2019m worried about regulations that make it hard for people to start businesses without 18 permits and 3 professional licenses, and I\u2019m worried at the state and city level about bad pension promises crowding out education and other spending. I\u2019m not a \u201cNo Tax Pledge\u201d Republican, but I am a \u201cWe better make damn sure every dollar we collect is spent wisely\u201d Republican. And by the way, I\u2019d note that my environmental views are in line with the party\u2019s history - Nixon created the EPA, Reagan created CARB in CA and fought for the Montr\u00e9al Protocol to deal with the ozone as President, and Bush 41 dealt with acid rain. As for gerrymandering? I don\u2019t see how it is a partisan issue. Anyone who defends it, like the Michigan GOP in this case, must be forgetting that if they lose power, the other side will pull the same trick. I can even make an argument that every free-market loving Republican should support reform. If your ideas aren\u2019t good enough to win without a fixed \u201cmarket\u201d of voters, well, that\u2019s how a market works. Better fix the product, or in this case, party, so that you can compete.\n\nI understand your frustration, but I do not believe the answer is every reasonable Republican becoming a Democrat. Right now, I can talk to Republicans who share my concerns and I can use my platform to talk about clean energy and redistricting reform. \n\nAs for the person who talked about taking action further down - I vote. I am usually fairly public about that. I\u2019ve never believed that belonging to a party means blindly voting for everyone else who does. I\u2019m also part of New Way California with a group of younger, problem solving legislators here who share a different vision for the party. It will take time.

We think life is alive and a slap of iron is not because, among a few other reasons, we have metabolism.  We consume energy in the service of our existence.

That is not likely at all because the periodic table of elements is full. There's no room for any other elements to be discovered in the natural universe.

Sorry for all whose questions follow this one.  Three hours is a good chunk of time for any activity.\n\nCurious thing about protests: People are shocked when they turn violent, with police exercising force far greater than the forces they oppose.  But its the very act of police violence that garners headlines. And it's those headlines that trigger change more than any other force.\n\nPeople praised Mayor Bloomberg for allowing the protesters to stay on location.  But it was not his authority to grant or deny.  The right to protest for grievances with the government to be redressed is fundamental to what it is to be American -- a nation founded on the need to protest the abuses of government.\n\nIn a free market economy you can't dictate the salaries of what a board chooses to compensate its executives. We have all bought into the capitalist system of our nation.  Outlawing the fact that some people get too much money would be like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.  But what one can do is draft a manifesto that offers guidelines for what is a sensible distribution of compensation in a company -- for example, setting a maximum ratio of salaries between the highest compensated person and the lowest.  Companies that comply would then get listed as best for its workers.  This would put social pressure on the system, in much the same way the Green Moment has put social pressure on companies to conduct business with greater respect for the environment.

But wouldn't it be impressive if I answered in less time than it took you to ask this question.\n\nWe've all heard of STEM, and it's gaining funding streams, attracting students into science programs - and that exists because *any* measure we can take of growth of economies traces to the roles of science and technology. It's the reality of things. We've known this since the Industrial Reveolution and beyond.\n\nWhat the Arts community has noticed is - why don't we *ride* that movement? And maybe stick an A in that STEM, and make it STEAM?\n\nAnd I think that's clever, and I don't have a problem with that. But be careful with what you're after. Because if you're going to assert that by training people in art, you will drive the economy in the same way you would with STEM - i don't see that happening. In fact, the great ways that art has driven the economy is when it's touched with technology. Look at cinema - technology adapted to create films. Green screen, the Steadicam, the roles that computers have played in generating cinema - I'm talking about kinds of art that is economically stable as a field, as opposed to art that requires charitable donations to sustain.\n\nSo when art DOES move the economy, it's generally because there's some form of technology that has touched it.\n\nBut another way to be honest with ourselves is to say that whether or not art moves the economy, art is something that humans have done as a species. And the great cities of Europe are remembered because of the great art they have fostered. When you go to Florence, you don't go there to drink the water. Art has value to us *culturally* whether or not you're going to assert it drives an economic sector.\n\nYou could make a country with *no* art - but is that a country you want to live in?\n\nYou can create a country without art. But who would live there? \n\nNot I! \n\nSo maybe the case for art should really be - *we should do this because we can.* We should do this because the greatest works of art are cherished over the centuries and over the millennia.

These are truths that can be established outside of your personal sensory perceptions. (The methods and tools of science are invented to enhance or replace the limited biological senses we're born with.)  If you cannot establish the truth of something outside of your own mind, then you hold what's called a personal truth. I rarely express public opinions, but one of them is that personal truths have no place in democratic governance.  Laws and legislation that apply to everyone need to be based in objective truths for them to have meaning to us all.  And evidence matters in establishing objective truths.  So personally, I guess my answer is no, I carry no assertions of truth for which there is no evidence to support it.  I may have a hypothesis that I'm testing.

But nothing deep. I occasionally thing about what art portrays culturally and scientifically.  In the Louvre, you have Leonardo's \"Mona Lisa\".  And around the corner, down the hall, there's a painting by Marie-Guillemine Benoist named simply \"Portrait of a Negress\".  I'm intrigued that, unlike the Mona Lisa, the black woman's name is not part of the painting's title.  I also note that most moons painted are either full or crescent.  Other moon shapes -- especially gibbous, that phase between half and full moon -- appear to be less aesthetically pleasing to the artist.  So I actually get excited when I find an illustrated moon in its gibbous phase.  One other thing I look for is which arm of Madonna is holding the baby Jesus. For most (> 90%) paintings I've seen across Europe, it's the left arm.  Since most people are right-handed, this makes sense, freeing the right hand for anything else.  But also, the human heart is loudest on the left side of your chest, and this sound is soothing to an infant.  So for any model sitting for the portrait, posing with an actual child, the child will more likely be calmer on the left side of her body.  So that makes sense too.  But in a recent trip to Venice, Italy -- my first time there -- a stunningly high percent of Madonna paintings portrayed the baby Jesus in her right arm.  I don't have an exact fraction, but it may be as high as 40%. This shocked me and I have no understanding of it.  -NDTyson", "length": 1463, "utc_timestamp": 1434077747.0, "subreddit": "r/Art", "score": {"compound": 26, "ups": 26, "downs": 0}, "vader": {"neg": 0.023, "neu": 0.887, "pos": 0.09, "compound": 0.9603}}, {"text": "Busy, abstract art.

Thank you for the good question. I believe I have been consistent throughout my political life in terms of my basic values and what I stand for. Obviously, when you are a United States senator working in a conservative environment, you often have to do the best that you can within the circumstances that you find yourself. Two particular examples: last year, I helped write the most comprehensive veterans legislation passed in many years. Trust me, I had to change my position on very important aspects of veterans' health care in order to get it passed. In terms of health care, I am an advocate of a Medicare-for-all single-payer program. I voted for the Affordable Care Act, not because I think it is the end place as to where we should be, but because I was able to get a major provision in it that greatly expanded primary health care -- which is helping many millions of people today. So the bottom line is that you have to stick by your values but when you're in an elected position, especially when you're in a conservative Congress, now and then you're going to have to compromise.\n\n2.

The only way we deal with the major issues facing our country -- raising the minimum wage to a living wage, rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, addressing climate change in a bold way, overturning Citizens United, demanding that the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes, making college affordable for all, etc. -- is when ordinary people put massive pressure on the Congress. Right now, the Congressional leadership represents the interests of the wealthiest people in this country and the largest corporations.

I've never had any problems answering that. I've never been at home seven night a week cooking for the kids. What I've instilled in the kids, from day one, is a work ethic. So, the time we spend together is limited, but it's quality. But, I made a conscious decision eighteen years ago when I opened the restaurant *Gordon Ramsay*, to strive to earn my third Michelin Star, I never wanted to open it weekends, so we closed Saturday and Sunday. So, they wouldn't see me eighteen hours a day Monday through Friday and they'd see me absolutely fucked on Saturday morning. But, we got to spend the quality time together. How does that resonate today? I only took them there for the first time two years ago. Because there was no way on earth that I was ever going to introduce to them that level of food and be served by twenty waiters and waited hand and foot on because it was their daddy's restaurant. I need to protect them and respect the restaurant and team in my restaurant. I made them as normal as possible, like I said, from the beginning they had a work ethic. They've all got jobs, they've all taken care of animals, they've all got housework. There's a rotor. They get pocket money, but they have to earn that pocket money. The well-respected Megan is at Oxford Brookes studying, she's doing a degree in Philosophy. Jack wants to be a marine. Holly was to go into fashion. And Tilly, Matilda, is the chef of the family. She has her own show on CBVCs on the BBC in the UK. They're all hard-working, passionate individuals that have respect for others and respect for life. And, more importantly, understand that if you want something in life, it's not passed over, a hand-me-down. They got to work for it. That's really important for me. \n\nListen, I was there. At his age at 39 and 29 and 19 behind the line. You have to make sacrifices. There's no fast-track to becoming successful. Yes, you can make it. 39 is not old and more importantly, be selective on what restaurant you're going to work in. If you're gonna go and spend eight to ten to twelve hours in a restaurant as a line cook then make sure it's a fucking great restaurant. Make sure they deserve your time and make sure every six months, you're climbing the ladder. Because if you're not then you're not working correctly and you're not playing to your strengths. Set aside that fact that your son is only five and don't look at the current situation and dictate that for the rest of your life. Climb the ladder, but make sure you're in a great restaurant. Don't try to climb the ladder in an average restaurant because you're not going anywhere. So, get yourself into a good restaurant. \n\nVery kind. Thank you. But there's one thing I learned as a young chef growing up and working my ass off in these restaurants. The sacrifice I was making was coming back tenfold in experience. There's nothing wrong with being behind the line, but being behind the line in a great place because at the end of that shift or that service, you're going back a much better person than you started the day with and that's what cooking is all about. And you've got to instill that, so make sure you don't waste time in the wrong restaurants.

And out of season, the locals--and in season--man that's your bread and butter. You have to look after them. And there is one or two ways across that hotel that you can appeal to them without sounding cheap or without sounding that you're degrading.

Because if you overcook them then obviously the cheese will start melting and it will burst through there. Or you can double coat them. So, flour, egg wash, breadcrumb and then do that again. If you put a second coating on top, slightly thicker, it will protect the cheese.

I started off teaching my kids with them and weighing out ingredients, prepping, peeling. But a really good way of making them excited and closely connected to it, is getting them to taste things. So as you're cooking, they may not be doing everything, but they're tasting things. Now that can't happen all throughout the cooking process, but I used to play games. I'd roll up fresh parsley, basil leaves, thyme flowers, and get them to smell, close their eyes and guess what it was. Cilantro, tarragon, chervil. And then I bought them all plant pots, so they cared for little miniature plant pots, and fresh basil, fresh parsley. And so they treated this plant as their little...how many times do you see hamsters or goldfish being bought? I bought all my kids little plant pots, basil plants, thyme, and they looked after them and they grew them. Outside herbs like rosemary. \n\nAnd so it's a really nice way of making them feel closer and a little bit more connected to food with the responsibility of looking after their little plants.

My kids, for instance now, they roast sweet potatoes, and they scrape the sweet potato out of the shell, and they mix it with the most amazing ingredients--scallions, garlic, chili--and they put it back into the sweet potato. So, there are other ways of making sides a little bit more adventurous for them by getting them to sort of work more on the vegetable point of view.

It involves members from preschool, kindergarten, universities, and everything in between. Its main message is every single one of us can make a difference. And make a difference every single day. Each group chooses themselves to help animals and wanting to help the environment. To educate young people to be better students, all the conservation work and other organizations to could benefit.

What had been stretching to the West Coast was now a tiny island surrounded by completely bare fields. People too poor to buy food from elsewhere. And struggling to survive. That is when it hit me. If we don't improve the lives of these people, there is no way we can conserve the chimpanzees. And that led to the Jane Goodall Institute program. We went not as a bunch of arrogant white people telling the villagers what to do to make their lives better, but with a hand-picked team sitting down, listening to the villagers, and asking them what they thought we could do to improve their lives. And that led to a very holistic program, which gradually grew and we could introduce new ways of helping. This paid off handsomely. The people in the villages are now our partners, helping us in conservation efforts. They've agreed to have a buffer between their villagers and the park to protect the chimpanzees. And the national Park, which was completely isolated, is now gradually being linked to other groups. And this program is now in 52 villages in the Gombe area, and it's in five other countries. And it is making a huge difference. Positive in introducing the youth program reaching the villages. It's probably the most important way in which we are able to conserve chimpanzee habitats. And I'll add to that, I would say we have placed great emphasis on education, helping them stay in school beyond puberty.

One example that has been before the Supreme Court is GPS tracking. In 2012, in United States v. Jones, the Supreme Court held that police need a search warrant to use a GPS device to track a suspect\u2019s car. Although the Justices split on their reasoning, five members of the Court held that at least longer-term GPS tracking requires a warrant (about a month in that case), even if shorter durations of tracking wouldn\u2019t. This reasoning recognizes that new surveillance technologies give the government unprecedented powers to amass large quantities of information about people at low cost, which requires careful judicial oversight. \n \nAs courts across the country have been struggling to ensure that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protections keep pace with the advance of technology, the mosaic theory has emerged as one effective tool. Cases involving cell phone location tracking, electronic medical records access, automated license plate readers, and other types of electronic surveillance are now or will soon be working their way through the courts. The mosaic theory isn\u2019t the only way to provide protections against unreasonable government surveillance, but it is a good option that we hope courts will continue to use.\n\nAs to Judge Garland, although he has never written an opinion addressing the mosaic theory, he did vote to uphold the D.C.

Some people may be rooting for Elon - I think he could, with his SpaceX, contribute considerably, enormously, to an international activity not only at the moon but also on Mars. I have considered whether a landing on Mars could be done by the private sector. It conflicts with my very strong idea, concept, conviction, that the first human beings to land on Mars should not come back to Earth. They should be the beginning of a build-up of a colony / settlement, I call it a \"permanence.\" A settlement you can visit once or twice, come back, and then decide you want to settle. Same with a colony. But you want it to be permanent from the get-go, from the very first. I know that many people don't feel that that should be done. Some people even consider it distinctly a suicide mission. Not me! Not at all. Because we will plan, we will construct from the moon of Mars, over a period of 6-7 years, the landing of different objects at the landing site that will be brought together to form a complete Mars habitat and laboratory, similar to what has been done at the Moon. Tourism trips to Mars and back are just not the appropriate way for human beings from Earth - to have an individual company, no matter how smart, send people to mars and bring them back, it is VERY very expensive. It delays the obtaining of permanence, internationally. Your question referred to a *monumental achievement by humanity* - that should not be one private company at all, it should be a collection of the best from all the countries on Earth, and the leader of the nation or the groups who makes a commitment to do that in 2 decades will be remembered throughout history, hundreds and thousands of years in the future of the history of humanity, beginning, commencing, a human occupation of the solar system.

He said that \"extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence to make them believable.\" There is not extraordinary evidence of (as far as I know) all the claims that have been made that we did NOT go to the Moon. There are photographs from lunar reconnaissance orbiter satellites, going around the moon, that clearly show all of the experiments that we described when we came back from the moon, and they are evidence that we were there, telling the truth, you can even see a trail of Neil Armstrong's trek (not footprints really but the stirred up dust in walking or jogging behind him) to see the west Crater that we had flown over, that Neil was concerned about landing close to that - and he took photos of that and then he went back to the spacecraft. I was back inside the spacecraft at this time, but looking at the photos of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiters, you can clearly see the evidence of Neil's trek. And he took photographs, and all the signs are still there. Our flag in Apollo 11 was, without the doubt, the best looking flag that was stuck on the moon. But it was close to the spacecraft, so when we lifted off, Neil observed that the rocket exhaust caused the flag to strike the ground, to fall over. And by this time, I'm sure the radiation in space has deteriorated every piece of cloth on the flags, whether they are flying on the surface or standing up. We perhaps in the future will have very accurate rovers that can approach the different landing sites, and perhaps make available to people back on earth the ability to control a video scan, get out elevations, with floodlights to illuminate during the 14 days of darkness - I believe this will be very inspiring to people back here on earth, if we have the funds to do that, it would be great to do that.\n\nThe space suit had a soft interior to the shoes, and when the boots got put over the shoes, there is much cushioning effect, and the light weight due to the reduced gravity and the thickness of the dust, made it difficult to sense the feel of the surface. it was so remarkable, the way the bootprints were left, with such strong definition of the soil underneath, like moist talcum powder I guess, it keeps its shape, so I photographed before and after, pictures of the surface, and then I thought that looked a little lonely, so I put another bootprint down, and moved my foot a little bit so you could see my foot and the bootprint. \n\nI have since been told by a comic, by a humorist, what humor really is - but just as we were leaving the moon, I had given some thought to this, and I was able to create two achievements of humor in one sentence. \n\nWhen Mission Control said, to us, as we were about to leave \"Tranquility bass, you are cleared for liftoff,\" I responded by saying to them \"Roger, Houston, we are number one on the runway.\"\n\nThere wasn't anybody else for us to be 2, 3, 4 to! But there wasn't any runway up there either!\n\nIt's a phrase most pilots hear many times - \"Roger Tower, acknowledge we are number 3 for takeoff on the runway\" Because there are people waiting before us in an airplane to start take off.

Now we are at 1/2 of 1% and have been that way for quite some while.

That's how we should go back to the Moon, not by competing with other nations, like China, to land our people - we've *done* that. The robotics, the operation of rovers and such at a great distance, has improved tremendously in the last 45 years. I don't believe the human mind has increased that much at all.

But we've done that, we can help the other nations, and we can help other nations use our facilities, and then we can deploy a radio telescope on Mars via balloon and design a strong suggestion for what the lunar base should be, on the near side & the far side, we can help in the construction of those elements, and we can bring those elements that are landed by other countries (because they are heavy, expensive) - we can bring them together and then the interface between elements that will come together in a complicated way because this is in a gravity field with uneven terrain, it's not as simple as the space shuttle docking with the space station, or any spacecraft, and zero gravity, it's much much more difficult, it requires (from a distance) bringing them sufficiently close and aligning them so that the two interfaces from adjacent cylinders (that may be 20 feet in diameter, 30 feet long, vertically part of the the shared space onboard the base) and from each one of these 3 can emanate 2 different nations for a total of 6 different individual nations growing outward for their habitation and laboratories and to control robots on the surface, to establish a distinct presence and yet sharing with the other people who have their personnel and their astronauts or the front or back side.

I just read this, and I seriously doubt it's veracity. I'm sure someone is carefully explicating this somewhere else in this thread, but for the record: \nThe resistance of air is 10k volts per centimeter (give or take). That means that if you have a wire with 10,000 volts in it trying to get somewhere, and you bring a grounded wire up to it, it won't make that leap across (called a spark) until the grounded wire is 1cm away. Again, give or take. \nSo think about static shocks you've gotten over the years. I'm sure you've actually at some point seen a spark from static electricity, right? Even seen it jump across air? Maybe something like 1/2 an inch? Given the above formula that's a static spark that's in excess of 10k volts. \n\nWe showed on MB that it's relatively easy (with the right fabrics etc) for someone to generate well in excess of 20k volts just moving around on a fabric car seat of the right material, while wearing clothing that aided and abetted the storing of static electricity. Static sparks are far higher in voltage than most people realize. 40k is on the high end from what I've researched, but not so far out of the realm of reasonable as the article would have us believe.\n\nBut as for setting fire to a carpet because of a 'perfect storm\" of static electricity gathering? Maybe if the carpet had just been cleaned with gasoline, but I'm dubious. \n\nOh, and by the way, it just made our master list. \n\nAnd by the way again, electricity myths are a pain in the ass. You can't see it, reading it can be difficult, people don't smoke and spark when they get electrocuted and you can't shoot a whole episode simply staring at values on an LCD meter. You have to actually DO something with the electricity that's televisual. Something that, in our experience, is a pain in the ass. \n\nThat is all for now. I am not a scientist, I play one on TV.

What myth did we want to do that the production wouldn't let us do? For the most part if we really wanted to do something, Discovery stood behind it. I might have answered this in another AMA, but I'll tell you there are three. There's one about a truck full of liquid oxygen that spills on a road bed and turns the entire road into a bomb. We played enough with liquid oxygen to respect its power and understand that it is some of the scariest stuff on earth. It can literally turn an oily rag into a bomb, and that's not exaggeration. It's terrifying. And to deal with an entire truck load on a road that might explode (or to be honest if we're gonna spend that much money, it has to explode one way or another) what we found was it was dangerous and unpredictable, and that made going full scale really really touchy, so we decided to leave that one. \n\nAnother one is upside down race car. But no one stood in our way of doing upside down race car. I should explain. Upside down race car is the myth that a formula one or indycar (two different kinds of cars, I'm totally aware of that) has so much down force because of its construction that it could drive upside down and still hug the road. We've been wanting to do this since season one. And number one, obviously we can't do it full scale with a road. We're not going to build a tunnel. That's hundreds of thousands of dollars, that's well more than the budget for an episode of MythBusters. We could do it potentially in a wind tunnel, but we could not find either a wind tunnel that would go fast enough, or two someone that would lend us their indycar or formula one car and allow us to hang it upside down in said wind tunnel. If said wind tunnel actually existed, be assured that it would cost in excess of $10,000 an hour to operate, and that right there also pushes us way to the outside edge of the MythBusters budget. \n\nLastly, there is an episode that we were going to do in the last season, but we didn't have time to complete, and so I had to let it go. It's a Native American myth, supposedly, that if you wanted to go duck hunting, you would float pumpkins in a pond that the ducks frequented and get them used to pumpkins floating around them. Then when you were hungry and wanted duck for dinner, you would put a pumpkin on your head and swim over to the duck that looked, I guess the tastiest, and the duck would not notice you because you're just a floating pumpkin. And then according to a hunter friend of mine you could reach out and pull the duck right under. Now we weren't gonna pull the duck under on camera, or at all because of, you know, cruelty to animals. But I did want to find out if I could swim up to a duck dressed as a pumpkin and capture it, because that would be amazing! Unfortunately, a couple of the episodes in our last season ended up being so difficult to shoot that we put those difficulties into the narratives, and thus we ended up with narratives that were fat enough we didn't need this secondary story. Pumpkin duck hunting was always going to be about a 12-13 minute story, not a very long one. And like I said, we ended up with enough narrative that we didn't need that, so I took one for the team and chucked it. So I'll never get to know.

Absolutely not. I mean, again this wasn't my concept. I came to this show as hired talent in the beginning and figured out my job on the fly, and my understanding of what that job was changed over the years. But because I came from behind the scenes, I mean I have some acting and performance training in my deep background as a high school student, but as a film crew member--model maker, rigger, all that stuff--I know that the rule of entertainment is that it's super fickle and the bottom can drop out any second. So every year that they renewed MythBusters for the first five or six years, I was like \"Really?! Cool!\" and we'd get another year to do this.  In the middle there, the middle few years, I was like \"Okay, you know, I feel like we can pretty much expect another year, that's great.\" and then at this point it felt like I'm not sure they're gonna renew it another year, that's when we worked with Discovery to shoot this final season. \n\nSo, never expected it to do as well. Never expected that we would become part of the cultural lexicon. We never intended to make a show that was educational for kids, that was fun to watch for the whole family. Seriously, none of that was on our radar. We were just telling stories of a couple of guys satisfying their curiosity in as rigorous a fashion as we could achieve within the confines of making a television show. The idea that I would then learn deeply about how creative the scientific method was, and how to tell stories about building rigorous methodologies is not something I ever expected. I'm astonished by how far and wide and deep MythBusters has gone around the world and in our culture and in me.\n\nI've never thought we were done testing myths. At the end of the first three pilots we shot in the summer of 2002, Jamie called me up about a week later and was like \"So that was fun\" and I was like \"Yea!\" He's like \"I don't know really where it could go. I mean, I think we pretty much did everything. Do you want this Impala?\" which is the Impala we used for rocket car, and I was like \"I can't store it, I don't have a garage,\" and he was like \"Alright, I'm gonna sell it. Well...talk to you later.\" and then we hung up. We didn't talk again really until after the show aired, which was January of 2003, and then Discovery awarded the show, I think less than two weeks later. It was amazing how quick it was. And again, I think we were talking at some point and Jamie was like \"I don't know what we're going to do because I think we've sort of answered everything.\" And it wasn't like I had this long list of things that I thought that we were gonna do, but we had no idea where we were gonna go. We didn't realize that film was going to provide all these wonderful movie stunt physics that we could test. Social media really didn't have a whole other world at the beginning. Things like Facebook or Twitter or Reddit weren't extant back then and part of the popular culture. Viral videos weren't a thing, and that's a massive amount of stories that we did. So that sort of gives you an idea about how the narratives that we built changed over the years. \n\nMy thoughts about staring down the inevitable end of MythBusters have gone through many stages. All of the stages of dealing with death, I would think. Anger, denial, bargaining, acceptance, etc. and I owe a great amount of thanks to Paget Brewster. Paget is a friend/acquaintance of mine through the Thrilling Adventure Hour theater players. In January of last year we were doing a thing here in San Francisco as part of San Francisco Sketchfest, and Paget said to me \"Oh, sweetie, your show is going to end in a year? You better get ready, because it's really going to fuck you up.\" And I was like \"Seriously? What?\" and she was like \"Yea, I was on my show for 6 years.\" She was on CSI for 6 years, and she was like \"When that ended, I found it really destabilizing and intense, and just when you've been doing the same thing for this long, get ready. It's going to affect you in all these ways you're not planning for.\" \n\nAnd it was a great gift that she gave me by telling me that was coming down the pipe. Because we started the last season, and it wasn't like we felt super elegiac about MythBusters ending at that point, and it wasn't until really--that was January we started filming that season--it wasn't really until September that the light at the end of the tunnel was clear, like \"Wow, we've only got like 9 weeks left.\" \"8 weeks left\" \"7 weeks left\". And thing that made me most sad is that I realized that I wasn't going to be making this show with these people. The MythBusters crew is the best working reality television crew in television. I'm not exaggerating, and I won't even qualify it. Those guys are incredible. They're my family, and we all effectively grew up together. Many of our people started off like a farm team of researchers and runners, and became producers and directors of photography, and became the best at those jobs. And looking around and realizing that this was the last time that I was going to be showing up on set every day and making up how to make this show every day with these amazing people, that's the part that I found the most difficult and the saddest. \n\nYou know, when I finally got back from our stage tour in December of 2015 and settled into the holidays, and then post-holidays when I settled into my unemployment, that affected me in a totally different way. It helped me understand how deeply I had identified with being \"the guy with the television show.\" and now I'm not the guy with the television show, and that's fine. It's just hard to see how much you attach your identification with the thing that you're doing until you're not doing it. And even though I was ready, I was like \"I'm ready, I'm ready for life without this show, ready to see what it\u2019s like, ready to deal with the difficulties.\u201d It doesn't even help knowing that the difficulties are coming. It's still difficult. It's still difficult because transition is tough. I mean if there is one thing about humans that's constant it's that we hate change. And it's weird because we seek it, we love change, and yet it's always destabilizing. I mean some people love it, I get it. Some people are going to post and go \"I love change!\" I get it. But I think most of us find moving our houses difficult. Changing jobs difficult. The things that we do and the ways in which we live our daily lives, they really do help us define ourselves to ourselves. And when those change, it starts to help illuminate the fact that our personalities are completely illusions. And it's a pervasive illusion, but it\u2019s an illusion all the less. There, I just got Buddhist on your ass. \n\nI think Buster's fist on the rocket sled was cast urethane rubber. And as for how many whacks of the champagne bottle, I think it took four or five. Which if there's several cut into the show, that's how many it took. We're not gonna cut any of those out because it's nothing but hilarious that it takes a while to smash a bottle over Buster's hard head.\n\nEdit: Fixed the year, thanks!

And I know that it's been going on so long that TED sometimes feels like a parody of itself, but to be at TED there's a couple of things I didn't realize. One is that all of the speakers, all the people who are giving talks at ted, are all a little bit freaked out about the weight of that red dot. \n\n\nYou know, you give your TED talk on this big round red carpet, and it does carry a weight. And the weight is that you want your talk to be resonant, and to be good. Because you do that, we're all working really hard on our talks. \n\n\nI spent so many hours running my talk, maybe 200 times. I memorized it until I could forget it and feel natural about delivering it, and it's a deep amount of work to get that. And everyone else is also freaking out about their talk, to get it right, and that engenders a bond between speakers that is really lovely. I made several friends at TED who i know will be life long friends, I'm not kidding. \n\n\nThe 2 most impressive talks at TED--one was by a new friend Adam Foss. It hasn't gone live yet, he's a prosecutor, it\u2019s an amazing talk. When it goes up, it\u2019s amazing. The other one was Al Gore, and that talk is up. I love Al Gore -- I believe in his mission. Al Gore is an amazing man, and what he's done for the world is hard to quantify or qualify. But I didn't think of Al Gore as a super dynamic speaker. I'll admit to you, I didn't think of him as like \"Well that's a gold standard\". But Gore got up and did a talk that took us all to school about giving a real talk in public. \n\n\nHe started out a little slow and then gut up to an almost country preacher, barn burner of a speech that's so inspiring at the same time he's calling out the dangers of what we're doing and how our behavior is going to harm us, and he's doing it all off the top of his head. There were no notes, there was no prompter, there was nothing against the back of the hall that he could read, and all of that data is coming out of him so naturally, so easily flowing, and working with the projections behind him that was a masterpiece to watch. And I was sitting next to another speaker and we were both like \"Holy shit balls!\" It was really an education in public speaking from someone who's been doing it for decades on the fly, off the top of their head, working hard.

OR Books, New York, 2012, 186 pages, Paper. Buy online. Cryptome review of the book.\n\nPages 1-7.\n\nINTRODUCTION: A CALL TO CRYPTOGRAPHIC ARMS\n\nThis book is not a manifesto. There is not time for that. This book is a warning.\n\nThe world is not sliding, but galloping into a new transnational dystopia. This development has not been properly recognized outside of national security circles. It has been hidden by secrecy, complexity and scale. The internet, our greatest tool of emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen. The internet is a threat to human civilization.\n\nThese transformations have come about silently, because those who know what is going on work in the global surveillance industry and have no incentives to speak out. Left to its own trajectory, within a few years, global civilization will be a postmodern surveillance dystopia, from which escape for all but the most skilled individuals will be impossible. In fact, we may already be there.\n\nWhile many writers have considered what the internet means for global civilization, they are wrong. They are wrong because they do not have the sense of perspective that direct experience brings. They are wrong because they have never met the enemy.\n\nNo description of the world survives first contact with the enemy.\n\nWe have met the enemy.\n\nOver the last six years WikiLeaks has had conflicts with nearly every powerful state. We know the new surveillance state from an insider's perspective, because we have plumbed its secrets. We know it from a combatant's perspective, because we have had to protect our people, our finances and our sources from it. We know it from a global perspective, because we have people, assets and information in nearly every country. We know it from the perspective of time, because we have been fighting this phenomenon for years and have seen it double and spread, again and again. It is an invasive parasite, growing fat off societies that merge with the internet. It is rolling over the planet, infecting all states and peoples before it.\n[..]\n\nDoes it even make sense to ask this question? In this otherworldly space, this seemingly platonic realm of ideas and information flow, could there be a notion of coercive force? A force that could modify historical records, tap phones, separate people, transform complexity into rubble, and erect walls, like an occupying army?\n\nThe platonic nature of the internet, ideas and information flows, is debased by its physical origins. Its foundations are fiber optic cable lines stretching across the ocean floors, satellites spinning above our heads, computer servers housed in buildings in cities from New York to Nairobi. Like the soldier who slew Archimedes with a mere sword, so too could an armed militia take control of the peak development of Western civilization, our platonic realm.\n\nThe new world of the internet, abstracted from the old world of brute atoms, longed for independence. But states and their friends moved to control our new world -- by controlling its physical underpinnings. The state, like an army around an oil well, or a customs agent extracting bribes at the border, would soon learn to leverage its control of physical space to gain control over our platonic realm. It would prevent the independence we had dreamed of, and then, squatting on fiber optic lines and around satellite ground stations, it would go on to mass intercept the information flow of our new world -- its very essence even as every human, economic, and political relationship embraced it. The state would leech into the veins and arteries of our new societies, gobbling up every relationship expressed or communicated, every web page read, every message sent and every thought googled, and then store this knowledge, billions of interceptions a day, undreamed of power, in vast top secret warehouses, forever. It would go on to mine and mine again this treasure, the collective private intellectual output of humanity, with ever more sophisticated search and pattern finding algorithms, enriching the treasure and maximizing the power imbalance between interceptors and the world of interceptees. And then the state would reflect what it had learned back into the physical world, to start wars, to target drones, to manipulate UN committees and trade deals, and to do favors for its vast connected network of industries, insiders and cronies.\n\nBut we discovered something. Our one hope against total domination. A hope that with courage, insight and solidarity we could use to resist. A strange property of the physical universe that we live in.\n\nThe universe believes in encryption.\n\nIt is easier to encrypt information than it is to decrypt it.\n\nWe saw we could use this strange property to create the laws of a new world. To abstract away our new platonic realm from its base underpinnings of satellites, undersea cables and their controllers. To fortify our space behind a cryptographic veil. To create new lands barred to those who control physical reality, because to follow us into them would require infinite resources.\n\nAnd in this manner to declare independence.\n\nScientists in the Manhattan Project discovered that the universe permitted the construction of a nuclear bomb. This was not an obvious conclusion. Perhaps nuclear weapons were not within the laws of physics. However, the universe believes in atomic bombs and nuclear reactors. They are a phenomenon the universe blesses, like salt, sea or stars.\n\nSimilarly, the universe, our physical universe, has that property that makes it possible for an individual or a group of individuals to reliably, automatically, even without knowing, encipher something, so that all the resources and all the political will of the strongest superpower on earth may not decipher it. And the paths of encipherment between people can mesh together to create regions free from the coercive force of the outer state. Free from mass interception. Free from state control.\n\nIn this way, people can oppose their will to that of a fully mobilized superpower and win. Encryption is an embodiment of the laws of physics, and it does not listen to the bluster of states, even transnational surveillance dystopias.\n\nIt isn't obvious that the world had to work this way. But somehow the universe smiles on encryption.\n\nCryptography is the ultimate form of non-violent direct action. While nuclear weapons states can exert unlimited violence over even millions of individuals, strong cryptography means that a state, even by exercising unlimited violence, cannot violate the intent of individuals to keep secrets from them.\n\nStrong cryptography can resist an unlimited application of violence. No amount of coercive force will ever solve a math problem.\n\nBut could we take this strange fact about the world and build it up to be a basic emancipatory building block for the independence of mankind in the platonic realm of the internet? And as societies merged with the internet could that liberty then be reflected back into physical reality to redefine the state?\n\nRecall that states are the systems which determine where and how coercive force is consistently applied.\n\nThe question of how much coercive force can seep into the platonic realm of the internet from the physical world is answered by cryptography and the cypherpunks' ideals.\n\nAs states merge with the internet and the future of our civilization becomes the future of the internet, we must redefine force relations.\n\nIf we do not, the universality of the internet will merge global humanity into one giant grid of mass surveillance and mass control.\n\nWe must raise an alarm. This book is a watchman's shout in the night.\n\nOn March 20, 2012, while under house arrest in the United Kingdom awaiting extradition, I met with three friends and fellow watchmen on the principle that perhaps in unison our voices can wake up the town. We must communicate what we have learned while there is still a chance for you, the reader, to understand and act on what is happening.\n\nIt is time to take up the arms of our new world, to fight for ourselves and for those we love.\n\nOur task is to secure self-determination where we can, to hold back the coming dystopia where we cannot, and if all else fails, to accelerate its self-destruction.\n\n-- Julian Assange, London, October 2012 \n\nhttp://cryptome.xxx/2012/12/assange-wl-arms-xxx.htm", "length": 8938, "utc_timestamp": 1428365360.0, "subreddit": "r/IAmA", "score": {"compound": 242, "ups": 242, "downs": 0}, "vader": {"neg": 0.067, "neu": 0.82, "pos": 0.113, "compound": 0.9974}}, {"text": "Most whistleblowers concentrate on their issue and their own legal cases, which can absord a lot of time and attention as it's their life or liberty on the line.

The US government wanted to publically destroy Manning, in a grotesque way, as a warning. They did not succeed but I realised we can do even better!

He is now mostly free, living a forfilling life of respect, an inspirational symbol for whistleblowers world wide and not a general deterrant suffering in a US prison unable to defend himself or promote his cause in public.\n\n\n\nAs I type these lines, on June 3, 2013, Private First Class Bradley Edward Manning is being tried in a sequestered room at Fort Meade, Maryland, for the alleged crime of telling the truth. The court martial of the most prominent political prisoner in modern US history has now, finally, begun.\n\nIt has been three years. Bradley Manning, then 22 years old, was arrested in Baghdad on May 26, 2010. He was shipped to Kuwait, placed into a cage, and kept in the sweltering heat of Camp Arifjan.\n\n\"For me, I stopped keeping track,\" he told the court last November. \"I didn\u2019t know whether night was day or day was night. And my world became very, very small. It became these cages... I remember thinking I\u2019m going to die.\"\n\nAfter protests from his lawyers, Bradley Manning was then transferred to a brig at a US Marine Corps Base in Quantico, VA, where - infamously - he was subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment at the hands of his captors - a formal finding by the UN. Isolated in a tiny cell for twenty-three out of twenty-four hours a day, he was deprived of his glasses, sleep, blankets and clothes, and prevented from exercising. All of this - it has been determined by a military judge - \"punished\" him before he had even stood trial.\n\n\"Brad\u2019s treatment at Quantico will forever be etched, I believe, in our nation\u2019s history, as a disgraceful moment in time\" said his lawyer, David Coombs. \"Not only was it stupid and counterproductive, it was criminal.\"\n\nThe United States was, in theory, a nation of laws. But it is no longer a nation of laws for Bradley Manning.\n\nWhen the abuse of Bradley Manning became a scandal reaching all the way to the President of the United States and Hillary Clinton\u2019s spokesman resigned to register his dissent over Mr. Manning\u2019s treatment, an attempt was made to make the problem less visible. Bradley Manning was transferred to the Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nHe has waited in prison for three years for a trial - 986 days longer than the legal maximum - because for three years the prosecution has dragged its feet and obstructed the court, denied the defense access to evidence and abused official secrecy. This is simply illegal - all defendants are constitutionally entitled to a speedy trial - but the transgression has been acknowledged and then overlooked.\n\nAgainst all of this, it would be tempting to look on the eventual commencement of his trial as a mercy. But that is hard to do.\n\nWe no longer need to comprehend the \"Kafkaesque\" through the lens of fiction or allegory. It has left the pages and lives among us, stalking our best and brightest. It is fair to call what is happening to Bradley Manning a \"show trial\". Those invested in what is called the \"US military justice system\" feel obliged to defend what is going on, but the rest of us are free to describe this travesty for what it is. No serious commentator has any confidence in a benign outcome. The pretrial hearings have comprehensively eliminated any meaningful uncertainty, inflicting pre-emptive bans on every defense argument that had any chance of success.\n\nBradley Manning may not give evidence as to his stated intent (exposing war crimes and their context), nor may he present any witness or document that shows that no harm resulted from his actions. Imagine you were put on trial for murder. In Bradley Manning\u2019s court, you would be banned from showing that it was a matter of self-defence, because any argument or evidence as to intent is banned. You would not be able to show that the \u2019victim\u2019 is, in fact, still alive, because that would be evidence as to the lack of harm.\n\nBut of course. Did you forget whose show it is?\n\nThe government has prepared for a good show. The trial is to proceed for twelve straight weeks: a fully choreographed extravaganza, with a 141-strong cast of prosecution witnesses. The defense was denied permission to call all but a handful of witnesses. Three weeks ago, in closed session, the court actually held a rehearsal. Even experts on military law have called this unprecedented.\n\nBradley Manning\u2019s conviction is already written into the script. The commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces, Barack Obama, spoiled the plot for all of us when he pronounced Bradley Manning guilty two years ago. \"He broke the law,\" President Obama stated, when asked on camera at a fundraiser about his position on Mr. Manning. In a civilized society, such a prejudicial statement alone would have resulted in a mistrial.\n\nTo convict Bradley Manning, it will be necessary for the US government to conceal crucial parts of his trial. Key portions of the trial are to be conducted in secrecy: 24 prosecution witnesses will give secret testimony in closed session, permitting the judge to claim that secret evidence justifies her decision. But closed justice is no justice at all.\n\nWhat cannot be shrouded in secrecy will be hidden through obfuscation. The remote situation of the courtroom, the arbitrary and discretionary restrictions on access for journalists, and the deliberate complexity and scale of the case are all designed to drive fact-hungry reporters into the arms of official military PR men, who mill around the Fort Meade press room like over-eager sales assistants. The management of Bradley Manning\u2019s case will not stop at the limits of the courtroom. It has already been revealed that the Pentagon is closely monitoring press coverage and social media discussions on the case.\n\nThis is not justice; never could this be justice. The verdict was ordained long ago. Its function is not to determine questions such as guilt or innocence, or truth or falsehood. It is a public relations exercise, designed to provide the government with an alibi for posterity. It is a show of wasteful vengeance; a theatrical warning to people of conscience.\n\nThe alleged act in respect of which Bradley Manning is charged is an act of great conscience - the single most important disclosure of subjugated history, ever. There is not a political system anywhere on the earth that has not seen light as a result. In court, in February, Bradley Manning said that he wanted to expose injustice, and to provoke worldwide debate and reform. Bradley Manning is accused of being a whistleblower, a good man, who cared for others and who followed higher orders. Bradley Manning is effectively accused of conspiracy to commit journalism.\n\nBut this is not the language the prosecution uses. The most serious charge against Bradley Manning is that he \"aided the enemy\" - a capital offence that should require the greatest gravity, but here the US government laughs at the world, to breathe life into a phantom. The government argues that Bradley Manning communicated with a media organisation, WikiLeaks, who communicated to the public. It also argues that al-Qaeda (who else) is a member of the public. Hence, it argues that Bradley Manning communicated \"indirectly\" with al-Qaeda, a formally declared US \"enemy\", and therefore that Bradley Manning communicated with \"the enemy\".\n\nBut what about \"aiding\" in that most serious charge, \"aiding the enemy\"? Don\u2019t forget that this is a show trial. The court has banned any evidence of intent. The court has banned any evidence of the outcome, the lack of harm, the lack of any victim. It has ruled that the government doesn\u2019t need to show that any \"aiding\" occurred and the prosecution doesn\u2019t claim it did. The judge has stated that it is enough for the prosecution to show that al-Qaeda, like the rest of the world, reads WikiLeaks.\n\n\u201cLiberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people,\" wrote John Adams, \"who have a right and a desire to know.\u201d\n\nWhen communicating with the press is \"aiding the enemy\" it is the \"general knowledge among the people\" itself which has become criminal. Just as Bradley Manning is condemned, so too is that spirit of liberty in which America was founded.\n\nIn the end it is not Bradley Manning who is on trial. His trial ended long ago. The defendent now, and for the next 12 weeks, is the United States. A runaway military, whose misdeeds have been laid bare, and a secretive government at war with the public. They sit in the docks.

We saw that evolve. It\u2019s both gratifying and alarming. I will explain why.\n\nI the rest of the team at WikiLeaks were very pleased there was such an expression of concern about how we were doing. We expected attacks against me. If you looked at my public statements and some of the statements tweeted by WikiLeaks in the lead up to my Internet being cut off and to that difficult diplomatic situation, we were saying that the attacks are going to come in and we will need people to defend us, we\u2019re going to need an army to get through this. And then the concern for how I was doing and why I wasn\u2019t being seen arose.\n\nMany were calling for \"proof of life\" but we are interested in something quite different. Anything that we did that claimed to be some kind of proof of life would be to set the precedent on what mechanism could be used to reduce concern about how we were faring. The calls, for example, that I issue a PGP signed message. \n\nThat's fine if you can understand that it\u2019s me issuing the PGP signed message, but a PGP signed message doesn\u2019t tell you who has issued it at all. It\u2019s just a plain message. So, let\u2019s look at what kind of precedent we would be setting. We would be setting the precedent that when there\u2019s a concern about whether one of our staff has been kidnapped or me, that concern can be destroyed simply by someone issuing of a message of text, which is coupled to a particular cryptographic key. \n\nBut if WikiLeaks is under a threat so serious that its people have been kidnapped then it is possible that it might lose control over its keys. The reality is that it\u2019s quite hard to protect keys from that kind of interference. The way WikiLeaks manages its keys, its submission keys, for example, they are not used to sign messages, but even if WikiLeaks did sign a message in this case, what would it be saying? It would be setting a precedent that could be very dangerous in the future.\n\nIf you produce the person and show that they are not under duress, you can either hack a WikiLeaks key or take control of infrastructure or take control of a person and then claim that they had produced some signed message.\n\nWe are much more interested in creating a precedent for proof of freedom from duress. Or making it hard for our people to be under duress. The best way to do that is live video. Because even if you were under duress (there\u2019s various forms of duress that could be applied) if you have live video then you\u2019ve got a few seconds to put things out. You can slip in code words into what you\u2019re saying. (I\u2019m not, by the way. I\u2019m not!) But you can slip in code words into what you\u2019re saying that your people could then see. So, yes, I\u2019m alive and free from duress, but I *am* in a very difficult situation.\n\nI have been for six years. Let\u2019s not think that I\u2019m not in a difficult situation just because I am alive. As I explained, this embassy is surrounded by high tech police and intelligence operation. It is a difficult situation. I haven\u2019t seen the sunlight in the last four and half years. It\u2019s a tough situation. I\u2019m tough, but you should be concerned about the situation.\n\nWhat we had hoped is those people concerned with my safety would direct their attention to those people who are responsible for the situation. That\u2019s the UK government, the US government, and the Ecuadorian government. Some of you did and that\u2019s quite possibly why my Internet has been restored--because of the expression of concern.\n\nBut, when the concern became very prominent, a black PR campaign infested the concern and tried take it off somewhere else and largely succeeded.\n\nWhat happened? Fabricated messages, claiming to be from our staff were posted on 4Chan on Reddit. Fabricated videos claiming to be from Anonymous [posted on YouTube]. Completely fabricated. Dozens of them. And what was their intent? What were they calling for? They were calling for people to not trust WikiLeaks, to not give it leaks, and to not give it funds!\n\nIt\u2019s obvious who benefits from the production of such a black PR campaign and it should be obvious in hindsight to all those people who were trying to support me that those types of messages were deliberately intended to undermine WikiLeaks and, in fact, undermine my support.\n\nIf this sort of thing happens in the future, think to yourselves, is what is claimed undermining the ability for WikiLeaks to operate, the ability for it to get new information, and the ability for it to financially support itself? And if the answer is yes then you should be extremely skeptical about what the claim is.\n\nHaving seen how concern for us can be manipulated and misled, but also the degree of concern, we now have a game plan for if this kind of thing happens again and I am confident about the kind of worldwide support we can get, if we get a similar type of attack again in the future.\n\nYou can see that I am speaking and maybe, apparently, sane, but don\u2019t reduce your concern. I am in a difficult situation. That\u2019s a reality. But the difficulty of the situation [has long been] expressed on Justice4Assange.com, UN findings, etc.\n\nWikiLeaks itself are also in a difficult situation.

Everyone in the media knows that we have a 100% accuracy rate. Despite our publications affecting powerful groups, which are by definition are connected to the establishment media, this media is in a difficult position. Due to the perfect credibility of our content, ad hominem attacks are used to color perception or create displacement because no direct attack is possible. So, we get all sorts of ad hominem attacks about WikiLeaks, about our sources and about me - i\u2019ve been called a cat torturer, A Mossad agent, CIA agent, a Russian agent now, and a pedophile twice recently on CNN (by the former CIA 2IC).\n\nWikiLeaks has published more than 800,000 documents that relate to Russia or Vladimir Putin. Most of those are critical. More than 2 million are from Syria. We have material from China, we\u2019ve been banned in China, etc. Each country\u2019s establishment tends to perceive WikiLeaks as something that is difficult for them and that erodes the authority of state institutions and that\u2019s true in the United States. \n\nWikiLeaks said it was ready to drop a bombshell on Russia? Not quite, we said we had important document pertaining to Russian corruption and yes, the FSB was apparently quoted as saying that they can electronically attack WikiLeaks. We published regardless. Those were the Russian-related documents in the our diplomatic cables series and they are extremely strong on Chechnya and Russian crime. A number of books were written from that, some calling Russia a mafia state. A number of successful lawsuits against the Russian State have made use of those documents and other documents.\n\nAnother common untruth is the claim that I worked for RT, the Russian State TV. It\u2019s absolutely false. In 2012, we setup a production company and our production company worked with Dartmouth Films, a UK production company and a distributor, Journeyman Pitches, and twelve episodes were filmed of me interviewing people.

They admit to spending 4 million pounds a year, just on the covert and overt police surveillance, not including MI5, etc. They have sophisticated robot cameras installed in different buildings, plainclothes police operating on the street and they\u2019ve done deals, of which we have the paperwork, with some of the opposing buildings owned by Harrods, which is a big department store here. Harrods is owned by the sovereign fund of Qatar.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not an easy environment to work in. Spying on the outside, some spying on the inside, informers, robot cameras, etc. \n\nThen during October, there was pressure applied by John Kerry and the US administration and other forms of pressure domestically within Ecuador, that resulted in my Internet connection being cut off and an increase in the security environment here, in terms of people getting in and out of the building easily, etc. It was wrong for John Kerry to politicize the office of the Secretary of State and try to use that for domestic political advantage by pressuring me through my political asylum. WikiLeaks does not publish from the embassy. It doesn\u2019t work from the embassy. I am political refugee stuck in this embassy because the UK refuses to obey international law and respect my asylum rights and let me leave the country. We publish from France, Germany, the Netherlands, and so on, a wide range of countries.

To be fair to Ecuador, they have denied that they were pressured, but that\u2019s not what our sources say.

It is a of show of force, presumably to make some kind of pressure for WikiLeaks to stop publishing, but we are setup to continue on regardless of what happens to me.\n\nNo one person in WikiLeaks can become a single point of failure.

He committed an important and brave act, which we supported. I worked with our legal team to get him out of Hong Kong and to a place of asylum. No other media organization did that. Not the Guardian, which had been publishing his material. Nor did Amnesty, human Rights Watch, not even any institution from a government. It was WikiLeaks that acted. A small, investigative publisher, which understands computer security, cryptography, the National Security Agency, which I have been publishing about for more than ten years, and asylum law, because of my situation.\n\nWe couldn't have a situation where Edward Snowden ends up in a position like Chelsea Manning and is used as a general deterrent to other whistleblowers stepping forward. Edward would have been imprisoned at any moment in Hong Kong and would have then been turned into the propaganda that if you\u2019re trying to do something important as a whistleblower, your voice will stopped and you\u2019ll be placed in prison in very adverse conditions.\n\nWe wanted the opposite. We wanted a general incentive for others to step forward. That\u2019s for philosophical reasons, because we understand the threat of mass surveillance, but it\u2019s also understandable for institutional reasons. WikiLeaks specializes in publishing what whistleblowers reveal and if there\u2019s a chill on sources stepping forward, that\u2019s not good for us as an institution. On the other hand, if people see yes, it\u2019s good for sources to step forward, then there will be more of them. \n\nOn full publication versus the sadly limited publication of Snowden files--Edward Snowden hasn\u2019t really had a choice. He has had various views that have shifted over time, but he is in a position where we made sure he had given the documents on him to journalists before he left Hong Kong. Both Edward Snowden and I assessed that it would be a dangerous bait for him to be carrying laptops with NSA material on it, as he transited through Russia to Latin America. That might be something that would cause the Russians to hold him. So he and we made sure he had nothing. Since the point of those initial disclosures, Edward Snowden hasn\u2019t been able to control how his publications have been used.\n\nEdward has been a very important voice in talking about the importance of different aspects of them, but he has had no control. The result is that more than 97% of the Snowden documents have been censored. Enormously important material censored and while there have been some good journalists working on them, and I think Glenn Greenwald is one of the best journalists publishing in the United States, you have to have hundreds of people and engineers working on material like this to understand what is going on.\n\nWe have a different position to those media organizations that have effectively privatized and limited that material. You can\u2019t say that the initial publications had all the important docs. There have been  more publications slowly as time goes by. Even some within the past two months. Those publications, for example, include ways to find interception sites in the United States used by the NSA. There are covert procedures to visiting those sites. Now, if those had been released in 2013, investigative journalists and individuals could have gone to those sites before there was a physical cover-up. That\u2019s true in the United States and it\u2019s true in Europe and elsewhere.

Why the irritation compared to publishing all at once? Critics would say, if we published all at once, that we deliberately made a giant bomb. You deliberately published all at once, in order to have maximum impact.\n\nIn WikiLeaks publications over the last ten years, we have used a variety of publication strategies depending on the amount of material, how readily engaged the audience is, and what the timeframe is for publication. What we have found is that we should closely match the demand curve with the supply curve. Humans can read a limited amount of words each day.\n\nThere is a finite number of people. There\u2019s a finite amount of time. There is a finite reading speed. So, the demand for words, even if an audience is 100% interested in that subject, is finite. It is optimal to match the demand for a particular type of information with the supply of that information. If there\u2019s oversupply of information, above the demand for it, then the oversupplied part is not read and of course, we want our publications to have maximum possible readership understanding. Our sources, of all kinds, want maximum possible impact. They don\u2019t want to go through these risks for their material to not be read.\n\nWe are proud of our election publication strategy. We had limited time and limited resources. Yes, we could have done things slightly differently if we had had more time more staff, etc, but within our resource constraints, we put together I think a pretty kick-ass publishing schedule designed to maximize uptake, readership, engagement, and knowledge extraction from our publications. \n\nThe strategy was designed to be hard to attack. What do I mean by that? Well, in this particular case, we have the Democratic campaign of Hillary Clinton and her associated media allies doing everything they could to spin what we were publishing.

We have had a number of these WikiLeaks war rooms and crisis teams setup against us by different governments and companies. From Bank of America to the Pentagon and State Department. They get ready each morning, wait for our publication, and then try to spin it. Insofar as our publications are at all predictable, that spin can be lined up ahead of time and those war rooms can be perfectly resourced. So, we made sure that what we were going to publish was unpredictable, when we were going to publish was unpredictable, how much we were going to publish each day was unpredictable, that we had both a human element looking closely at what was happening on the news and on social media and an algorithm, which also introduced cryptographically secure noise into publication decisions in relation to amounts and timings and making that decision on the fly, not a month ahead of time with a schedule all planned out.

Not in relation to us being under pressure. We have been under a lot of pressure, but we\u2019re very good at resisting pressure. But, in relation to whether I\u2019m alive or kidnapped. If you look at people like John Pilger, for example, long-term friend of mine, runs my defense fund, is a famously brave investigative reporter, my lawyers, close friends, people like Lauri Love, the Ecuadorian government. If you think about the number of people who would actually have to conspire and the amount of work that would have to be done to produce these false images is too many. That\u2019s a social proof. And to understand that, one needs to look at the costs and understand the costs involved in trying to pull together all those people and trying to keep a lid on them and engage in all this kind of fabrication technology, which does not yet exist, as far as anyone can tell, in a capacity to do what is done. To do all that, that\u2019s the cost. And then, but for what benefit? That\u2019s an interesting question.\n\nIn thinking about real-time proof of life, intellectually, the most interesting [method] is to take the most recent block in the blockchain, in the bitcoin blockchain, give the number and at least eight digits or something of the hash and then maybe to spell out this hash by sign language. That\u2019s intellectually entertaining, but what is the problem with it?\n\nWell, let\u2019s see if I can get a recent hash. While it\u2019s intellectually entertaining, the problem with it is this \u2014 it\u2019s very complicated, the underlying technology, so it has the same flaw that sophisticated voting machines have, cryptographic voting machines, which is the average person can\u2019t understand whether the security claims are in fact born out. Now experts might be able to, but the average person can\u2019t and so then you\u2019re back to a social proof. Does the average person trust the expert? And then how do they know that those experts are really experts that haven\u2019t been compromised?\n\nSo, in fact, while it\u2019s intellectually entertaining, it\u2019s not at all a good type of proof of currency. But, I\u2019ll give one anyway, so this is block 445706 and the hash is 178374F687728789CAA92ECB49. Ok, I think I made a mistake in the block number, which is going to drive everyone crazy! So, the block number 447506. This is how you can tell it\u2019s real time because of mistakes! Hash 178374F687728789CAA92ECB49. OK, intellectually entertaining.\n\nYou don\u2019t actually have to read out the whole hash number, maybe eight digits or so combined with a block number would be enough to show currency within a ten minute, hour, period, something like that. But the better way to show currency is news that can be widely checked, is widely spread, and is unpredictable before it happens. The best would be a few different natural disasters, maybe a lot of weather measurements, and otherwise need something that\u2019s not easily predicted and which can be widely checked or widely seen at the time. And a good example of that is sports scores. \n\nFor example, the New Orlean Pelicans versus the NY Knicks won 110-96, Oklahoma 109 versus 94 Chicago, Dallas 92 versus 101 for Minnesota. So, that can give you currency.\n\nIn terms of any future precedent, if I disappear or someone else disappears, the answer to if we are OK or under duress should be given by two things in future: Number one by lawyers, publicly associated close friends, people who fund my defense campaign. So, let\u2019s look at those. John Pilger, The Courage Foundation, people associated with it, my lawyers, such as Jennifer Robinson, Margaret Ratner in the United States, Melinda Taylor.\n\nAnd [number two] the ability to do live interactive video, where someone, even though theoretically they could be under duress, can interject in the stream quickly to say such a thing or to give a variety of messages in a live way, which each one is not comprehensible at the time that is said, but the last one, if you like, provides the conceptual key to decrypt them. (I am not doing this now! I am not doing this now!).\n\nI very much appreciate the support. It had some good effects. I think it probably contributed significantly to restoring my Internet. \n\nBut a lot of that well-intentioned support was waylaid by a black PR campaign, so don\u2019t let that happen again.

But that\u2019s a discussion question by a support group who explicitly stated that it\u2019s not about publishing addresses.\n\nBut why is that story spreading? It\u2019s spreading because of two reasons. Number one, as a result of the efficacy of our publications and their perceived damage to the US ruling class, there\u2019s a desire to reduce our reputation in the establishment press, so such Tweets are grabbed onto, re-assigned, taken out of context, and promoted. I also see a second reason, which is interesting. Is there exists a two-level class hierarchy on Twitter. People with blue ticks and people without blue ticks. There\u2019s about 230,000 users with blue ticks and they correspond with something like about 30% of people who would consider themselves members of the establishment in English speaking countries. Those are MPs, journalists, CEOs, etc. People who are representatives in some way and therefore have a need to interface with the public. About a third of those types, in particular, the upcoming ones, are on Twitter and they have blue ticks. So you have here both an identity phenomenon (where someone is branded with an identity of a blue tick and so an identity politics is emerging within this group) and also a class phenomenon. The recontextualization of the WikiLeaks Task Force discussion point into a threat against this identity group was then widely spread by self same identity group which also lined up fairly neatly with the \"liberal\" establishment politics of something like 80% of that identity group.\n\nThink about this new emerging identity class. It has a quality. Within the blue tick class that is you have a blue tick or you don\u2019t. So metrics looking at what the relationships are between people in the blue tick identity class and exterior (of Twitter) class dynamics, relationships to power of various kinds, removes some part of the equalitarian nature within the blue tick identity class, which can be seen a a threat to those people who have gained the blue tick, but are otherwise not in power in the exterior class.

The US government wanted to publically destroy Manning, in a grotesque way, as a warning. They did not succeed but I realised we can do even better!

He is now mostly free, living a forfilling life of respect, an inspirational symbol for whistleblowers world wide and not a general deterrant suffering in a US prison unable to defend himself or promote his cause in public.\n\nHere's what I wrote about Manning as his trial started. These words are still true:\n\nAs I type these lines, on June 3, 2013, Private First Class Bradley Edward Manning is being tried in a sequestered room at Fort Meade, Maryland, for the alleged crime of telling the truth. The court martial of the most prominent political prisoner in modern US history has now, finally, begun.\n\nIt has been three years. Bradley Manning, then 22 years old, was arrested in Baghdad on May 26, 2010. He was shipped to Kuwait, placed into a cage, and kept in the sweltering heat of Camp Arifjan.\n\n\"For me, I stopped keeping track,\" he told the court last November. \"I didn\u2019t know whether night was day or day was night. And my world became very, very small. It became these cages... I remember thinking I\u2019m going to die.\"\n\nAfter protests from his lawyers, Bradley Manning was then transferred to a brig at a US Marine Corps Base in Quantico, VA, where - infamously - he was subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment at the hands of his captors - a formal finding by the UN. Isolated in a tiny cell for twenty-three out of twenty-four hours a day, he was deprived of his glasses, sleep, blankets and clothes, and prevented from exercising. All of this - it has been determined by a military judge - \"punished\" him before he had even stood trial.\n\n\"Brad\u2019s treatment at Quantico will forever be etched, I believe, in our nation\u2019s history, as a disgraceful moment in time\" said his lawyer, David Coombs. \"Not only was it stupid and counterproductive, it was criminal.\"\n\nThe United States was, in theory, a nation of laws. But it is no longer a nation of laws for Bradley Manning.\n\nWhen the abuse of Bradley Manning became a scandal reaching all the way to the President of the United States and Hillary Clinton\u2019s spokesman resigned to register his dissent over Mr. Manning\u2019s treatment, an attempt was made to make the problem less visible. Bradley Manning was transferred to the Midwest Joint Regional Correctional Facility at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.\n\nHe has waited in prison for three years for a trial - 986 days longer than the legal maximum - because for three years the prosecution has dragged its feet and obstructed the court, denied the defense access to evidence and abused official secrecy. This is simply illegal - all defendants are constitutionally entitled to a speedy trial - but the transgression has been acknowledged and then overlooked.\n\nAgainst all of this, it would be tempting to look on the eventual commencement of his trial as a mercy. But that is hard to do.\n\nWe no longer need to comprehend the \"Kafkaesque\" through the lens of fiction or allegory. It has left the pages and lives among us, stalking our best and brightest. It is fair to call what is happening to Bradley Manning a \"show trial\". Those invested in what is called the \"US military justice system\" feel obliged to defend what is going on, but the rest of us are free to describe this travesty for what it is. No serious commentator has any confidence in a benign outcome. The pretrial hearings have comprehensively eliminated any meaningful uncertainty, inflicting pre-emptive bans on every defense argument that had any chance of success.\n\nBradley Manning may not give evidence as to his stated intent (exposing war crimes and their context), nor may he present any witness or document that shows that no harm resulted from his actions. Imagine you were put on trial for murder. In Bradley Manning\u2019s court, you would be banned from showing that it was a matter of self-defence, because any argument or evidence as to intent is banned. You would not be able to show that the \u2019victim\u2019 is, in fact, still alive, because that would be evidence as to the lack of harm.\n\nBut of course. Did you forget whose show it is?\n\nThe government has prepared for a good show. The trial is to proceed for twelve straight weeks: a fully choreographed extravaganza, with a 141-strong cast of prosecution witnesses. The defense was denied permission to call all but a handful of witnesses. Three weeks ago, in closed session, the court actually held a rehearsal. Even experts on military law have called this unprecedented.\n\nBradley Manning\u2019s conviction is already written into the script. The commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces, Barack Obama, spoiled the plot for all of us when he pronounced Bradley Manning guilty two years ago. \"He broke the law,\" President Obama stated, when asked on camera at a fundraiser about his position on Mr. Manning. In a civilized society, such a prejudicial statement alone would have resulted in a mistrial.\n\nTo convict Bradley Manning, it will be necessary for the US government to conceal crucial parts of his trial. Key portions of the trial are to be conducted in secrecy: 24 prosecution witnesses will give secret testimony in closed session, permitting the judge to claim that secret evidence justifies her decision. But closed justice is no justice at all.\n\nWhat cannot be shrouded in secrecy will be hidden through obfuscation. The remote situation of the courtroom, the arbitrary and discretionary restrictions on access for journalists, and the deliberate complexity and scale of the case are all designed to drive fact-hungry reporters into the arms of official military PR men, who mill around the Fort Meade press room like over-eager sales assistants. The management of Bradley Manning\u2019s case will not stop at the limits of the courtroom. It has already been revealed that the Pentagon is closely monitoring press coverage and social media discussions on the case.\n\nThis is not justice; never could this be justice. The verdict was ordained long ago. Its function is not to determine questions such as guilt or innocence, or truth or falsehood. It is a public relations exercise, designed to provide the government with an alibi for posterity. It is a show of wasteful vengeance; a theatrical warning to people of conscience.\n\nThe alleged act in respect of which Bradley Manning is charged is an act of great conscience - the single most important disclosure of subjugated history, ever. There is not a political system anywhere on the earth that has not seen light as a result. In court, in February, Bradley Manning said that he wanted to expose injustice, and to provoke worldwide debate and reform. Bradley Manning is accused of being a whistleblower, a good man, who cared for others and who followed higher orders. Bradley Manning is effectively accused of conspiracy to commit journalism.\n\nBut this is not the language the prosecution uses. The most serious charge against Bradley Manning is that he \"aided the enemy\" - a capital offence that should require the greatest gravity, but here the US government laughs at the world, to breathe life into a phantom. The government argues that Bradley Manning communicated with a media organisation, WikiLeaks, who communicated to the public. It also argues that al-Qaeda (who else) is a member of the public. Hence, it argues that Bradley Manning communicated \"indirectly\" with al-Qaeda, a formally declared US \"enemy\", and therefore that Bradley Manning communicated with \"the enemy\".\n\nBut what about \"aiding\" in that most serious charge, \"aiding the enemy\"? Don\u2019t forget that this is a show trial. The court has banned any evidence of intent. The court has banned any evidence of the outcome, the lack of harm, the lack of any victim. It has ruled that the government doesn\u2019t need to show that any \"aiding\" occurred and the prosecution doesn\u2019t claim it did. The judge has stated that it is enough for the prosecution to show that al-Qaeda, like the rest of the world, reads WikiLeaks.\n\n\u201cLiberty cannot be preserved without a general knowledge among the people,\" wrote John Adams, \"who have a right and a desire to know.\u201d\n\nWhen communicating with the press is \"aiding the enemy\" it is the \"general knowledge among the people\" itself which has become criminal. Just as Bradley Manning is condemned, so too is that spirit of liberty in which America was founded.\n\nIn the end it is not Bradley Manning who is on trial. His trial ended long ago. The defendent now, and for the next 12 weeks, is the United States. A runaway military, whose misdeeds have been laid bare, and a secretive government at war with the public. They sit in the docks.

OR Books, New York, 2012, 186 pages, Paper. Buy online. Cryptome review of the book.\n\nPages 1-7.\n\nINTRODUCTION: A CALL TO CRYPTOGRAPHIC ARMS\n\nThis book is not a manifesto. There is not time for that. This book is a warning.\n\nThe world is not sliding, but galloping into a new transnational dystopia. This development has not been properly recognized outside of national security circles. It has been hidden by secrecy, complexity and scale. The internet, our greatest tool of emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen. The internet is a threat to human civilization.\n\nThese transformations have come about silently, because those who know what is going on work in the global surveillance industry and have no incentives to speak out. Left to its own trajectory, within a few years, global civilization will be a postmodern surveillance dystopia, from which escape for all but the most skilled individuals will be impossible. In fact, we may already be there.\n\nWhile many writers have considered what the internet means for global civilization, they are wrong. They are wrong because they do not have the sense of perspective that direct experience brings. They are wrong because they have never met the enemy.\n\nNo description of the world survives first contact with the enemy.\n\nWe have met the enemy.\n\nOver the last six years WikiLeaks has had conflicts with nearly every powerful state. We know the new surveillance state from an insider's perspective, because we have plumbed its secrets. We know it from a combatant's perspective, because we have had to protect our people, our finances and our sources from it. We know it from a global perspective, because we have people, assets and information in nearly every country. We know it from the perspective of time, because we have been fighting this phenomenon for years and have seen it double and spread, again and again. It is an invasive parasite, growing fat off societies that merge with the internet. It is rolling over the planet, infecting all states and peoples before it.\n[..]\n\nDoes it even make sense to ask this question? In this otherworldly space, this seemingly platonic realm of ideas and information flow, could there be a notion of coercive force? A force that could modify historical records, tap phones, separate people, transform complexity into rubble, and erect walls, like an occupying army?\n\nThe platonic nature of the internet, ideas and information flows, is debased by its physical origins. Its foundations are fiber optic cable lines stretching across the ocean floors, satellites spinning above our heads, computer servers housed in buildings in cities from New York to Nairobi. Like the soldier who slew Archimedes with a mere sword, so too could an armed militia take control of the peak development of Western civilization, our platonic realm.\n\nThe new world of the internet, abstracted from the old world of brute atoms, longed for independence. But states and their friends moved to control our new world -- by controlling its physical underpinnings. The state, like an army around an oil well, or a customs agent extracting bribes at the border, would soon learn to leverage its control of physical space to gain control over our platonic realm. It would prevent the independence we had dreamed of, and then, squatting on fiber optic lines and around satellite ground stations, it would go on to mass intercept the information flow of our new world -- its very essence even as every human, economic, and political relationship embraced it. The state would leech into the veins and arteries of our new societies, gobbling up every relationship expressed or communicated, every web page read, every message sent and every thought googled, and then store this knowledge, billions of interceptions a day, undreamed of power, in vast top secret warehouses, forever. It would go on to mine and mine again this treasure, the collective private intellectual output of humanity, with ever more sophisticated search and pattern finding algorithms, enriching the treasure and maximizing the power imbalance between interceptors and the world of interceptees. And then the state would reflect what it had learned back into the physical world, to start wars, to target drones, to manipulate UN committees and trade deals, and to do favors for its vast connected network of industries, insiders and cronies.\n\nBut we discovered something. Our one hope against total domination. A hope that with courage, insight and solidarity we could use to resist. A strange property of the physical universe that we live in.\n\nThe universe believes in encryption.\n\nIt is easier to encrypt information than it is to decrypt it.\n\nWe saw we could use this strange property to create the laws of a new world. To abstract away our new platonic realm from its base underpinnings of satellites, undersea cables and their controllers. To fortify our space behind a cryptographic veil. To create new lands barred to those who control physical reality, because to follow us into them would require infinite resources.\n\nAnd in this manner to declare independence.\n\nScientists in the Manhattan Project discovered that the universe permitted the construction of a nuclear bomb. This was not an obvious conclusion. Perhaps nuclear weapons were not within the laws of physics. However, the universe believes in atomic bombs and nuclear reactors. They are a phenomenon the universe blesses, like salt, sea or stars.\n\nSimilarly, the universe, our physical universe, has that property that makes it possible for an individual or a group of individuals to reliably, automatically, even without knowing, encipher something, so that all the resources and all the political will of the strongest superpower on earth may not decipher it. And the paths of encipherment between people can mesh together to create regions free from the coercive force of the outer state. Free from mass interception. Free from state control.\n\nIn this way, people can oppose their will to that of a fully mobilized superpower and win. Encryption is an embodiment of the laws of physics, and it does not listen to the bluster of states, even transnational surveillance dystopias.\n\nIt isn't obvious that the world had to work this way. But somehow the universe smiles on encryption.\n\nCryptography is the ultimate form of non-violent direct action. While nuclear weapons states can exert unlimited violence over even millions of individuals, strong cryptography means that a state, even by exercising unlimited violence, cannot violate the intent of individuals to keep secrets from them.\n\nStrong cryptography can resist an unlimited application of violence. No amount of coercive force will ever solve a math problem.\n\nBut could we take this strange fact about the world and build it up to be a basic emancipatory building block for the independence of mankind in the platonic realm of the internet? And as societies merged with the internet could that liberty then be reflected back into physical reality to redefine the state?\n\nRecall that states are the systems which determine where and how coercive force is consistently applied.\n\nThe question of how much coercive force can seep into the platonic realm of the internet from the physical world is answered by cryptography and the cypherpunks' ideals.\n\nAs states merge with the internet and the future of our civilization becomes the future of the internet, we must redefine force relations.\n\nIf we do not, the universality of the internet will merge global humanity into one giant grid of mass surveillance and mass control.\n\nWe must raise an alarm. This book is a watchman's shout in the night.\n\nOn March 20, 2012, while under house arrest in the United Kingdom awaiting extradition, I met with three friends and fellow watchmen on the principle that perhaps in unison our voices can wake up the town. We must communicate what we have learned while there is still a chance for you, the reader, to understand and act on what is happening.\n\nIt is time to take up the arms of our new world, to fight for ourselves and for those we love.\n\nOur task is to secure self-determination where we can, to hold back the coming dystopia where we cannot, and if all else fails, to accelerate its self-destruction.\n\n-- Julian Assange, London, October 2012 \n\nhttp://cryptome.xxx/2012/12/assange-wl-arms-xxx.htm", "length": 8938, "utc_timestamp": 1428365360.0, "subreddit": "r/IAmA", "score": {"compound": 1, "ups": 1, "downs": 0}, "vader": {"neg": 0.067, "neu": 0.82, "pos": 0.113, "compound": 0.9974}}, {"text": "When cases are high profile they are always political.

I was in Prague shooting *The Brothers Grimm*, we were in rehearsals, and I had a wig in that movie, and so Alec and Dave and Jeff were making *EuroTrip* and they said \"Will you come play this, you know, Howard Rollins kind of insane, bad version of a suburban, you know, punk band guy?\" And I said \"Yea, I'm in Prague\".  So I showed up and I'm sitting there, and I'm like \"I'm wearing a wig, just shave my head, let\u2019s just go for it.\" and we did it, and put a bunch of piercings all over. And \"Scotty Doesn't Know\", the song, was actually written by one of my college roommates brothers, and in the band, one of my college roommates is actually in that back up band, Jason, is playing guitar in that group. So it was kind of a family affair. \n\nIt's tough to choose, like between films you've been in. I don't think I'm the best objective judge of any of those films. I mean *Private Ryan* was obviously the most significant in my life because it was right when my career was starting and it came out right after *Good Will Hunting*, and it did a lot to kind of position me, you know, as an actor that a studio would take a chance on. So that was probably the most influential on my life. I haven't seen the movie in a long time, I remember loving it and being deeply grateful that I was in it, and thinking that Steven was really at the top of his game, as was Tom. So that movie was always, you know I think of *Interstellar* and *The Martian* as things I made in my 40s. My life is very different, so I almost couldn't categorize those three movies.

They talk about accountability, but they\u2019re measuring with these standardized tests, which I believe in my heart they will start fading out.  It just demonstrably does not work. No Child Left Behind does not work. I\u2019ve always believed that they have to invite teachers into the discussion to help design policy.

This was for one of those libertarian websites and they had an attack question planned about tenure. Diane Ravitch was there, she\u2019s a huge figure in education and she jumped in and just set them straight about what having tenure meant.  It just basically means you have the right to be represented, and have your side of something heard if someone is trying to get rid of you.

I felt like with my name I could use whatever influence I had to direct money to good places. Then as I learned more and more about it and the deeply complex nature of the issues. I felt like I could maximize my impact more if I partnered with the preeminent expert in the space, somebody who I would be lucky to partner with, quite frankly. That's what led me to Gary White. I asked him and he said yes, the rest is history. That was in 2009. To date, actually we just got the numbers in recently, we have delivered water and sanitization solutions to 4.6 million people. That number is growing exponentially because of our system of water credit. It's using the concepts of micro-finance that Mohamed Eunice pioneered and applying them to the water sector. What's great about it is our loans are paying back at over 99% and that money just gets recycled. It's this virtuous circle.

I addressed the first two in other answers. But to the third question, I have many times. My initial connection to the issue resulted from a trip for a different purpose that eventually led me to co-founding Water.org.  In 2006, I went on a field trip that was set up by Bono\u2019s organization, which was an incredible opportunity, a chance to go to Africa (Zambia and South Africa), and learn about issues of extreme poverty.  Each day had a different learning focus. One day we\u2019d be doing urban AIDS and be in AIDS clinics in Johannesburg.  The trip was probably a week or 10 days, and one of the learning focus days was water.  \n\nI think as I looked at it and started to grasp the enormity of the issue, it seemed like water underpinned everything and no one was talking about it. And yet, 2 million kids are dying every year because of issues of clean water and sanitation, and I\u2019d never heard anyone talk about it.  And so, as I was intellectually learning about it, I had this experience of going on a water collection with a girl who was 14. She picked up a jerry can, and I picked up a jerry can, and we walked a mile to this well and gathered water together. We talked the whole way, and had this real connection, and she confided in me. I asked her what her hopes were. She was going to move to the big city and be a nurse.  The way she talked about it, I remembered being a 14-year old kid, and Ben and me talking about moving to New York City. It hit me that if someone hadn\u2019t built a well a mile from her house, she never would have had had these dreams, she wouldn\u2019t be in school.  She\u2019d have no prospects for any kind of dignified life. She\u2019d spend all of her time trying to get water for her and her family.  It wasn\u2019t just these ridiculous deaths from things we\u2019ve solved in the West, it was about human dignity. I started thinking about it and how it was what I wanted to focus on.  Around that time my company did a documentary about ultra-marathoners running across the Sahara Desert, so I decided to use that as a way to identify water NGOs on the route that were doing great work, for whom I could raise money. So we started a foundation called H20 Africa.  I kind of intellectually knew that was not the answer, that wells alone were not going to solve this problem, but I figured, what the heck, I can do some good, and something is better than nothing. I can probably reach thousands of people that way. We started to raise a good amount of money.  I started to get more sophisticated with my understanding of the problem, and my thinking, and what my contribution could be. I started looking for the preeminent water expert and someone I could team up with. It led me to Gary White, so I went to him and asked if we could join forces and work together and luckily he agreed. We co-founded Water.org, and what makes it different is how we approach the problem and our perspective about innovation.\n\n", "length": 2949, "utc_timestamp": 1391708454.0, "subreddit": "r/IAmA", "score": {"compound": 873, "ups": 873, "downs": 0}, "vader": {"neg": 0.053, "neu": 0.801, "pos": 0.146, "compound": 0.9954}}]}, "Daniel Radcliffe": {"username": "Daniel-Radcliffe", "commentCount": 73, "avgCommentLenth": 388.6849315068493, "vader": {"compound": 0.6213068493150685, "neg": 0.03765753424657535, "neu": 0.7698356164383561, "pos": 0.19246575342465755}, "avgScore": {"compound": 2044.2876712328766, "ups": 2044.2876712328766, "douns": 0.0}, "comments": [{"text": "*WOW.*\n\nUm... that's a really good question.

A while ago, it was brought to my attention that I was being accused of creating fake accounts for upvotes, or gaming the system so to speak.  Today, I was told the same issue keeps being brought up so I wanted to respond directly to all of this, because it\u2019s entirely untrue.   I don\u2019t really understand where these accusations are coming from, but allow me to explain my history with Reddit, and perhaps it will clear things up. \n\nIronically, I\u2019ve been pretty unfamiliar with reddit for my entire life, up until my music videos began being posted. I had obviously heard about it, but didn\u2019t really know what it was, or actively reddit or anything.  Back in the day, when my first video (ex-boyfriend) was posted and doing well on reddit, I posted on my personal facebook account, informing my friends of such, and saying \u201cgo upvote it if you get the chance!\u201d or something of that nature.  I did it without any knowledge that something like that was \u201cagainst the rules\u201d or frowned upon on reddit. Remember, this is a guy who doesn\u2019t know a thing about the site or how it works at that point in time. In my mind, it made sense to have a few friends support the cause, the way they do when they share my videos on their facebooks and stuff.  I assume about 10 friends of mine ended up making an account, and upvoted the first few videos that came out within a month of my existence on the internet. As soon as I got wind that this was actually frowned upon, I immediately told them to stop.  So, at the height of this alleged scandal, it wasn\u2019t more than 10-15 friends of mine casually upvoting my first month\u2019s worth of content when something got posted on reddit. Nothing beyond that.  I imagine out of the tens of thousands of upvotes that those videos received, my friends\u2019 impact was rather negligible. I think my videos are just designed to do well on user-driven platforms like reddit.  Around that time, I was also contacted by a mod who wanted to hear my side of things given it was repeatedly being suggested that I was using fake accounts.  I told him all the same things I am telling you guys here, figured he would try to get to the bottom of it, and hopefully clear my good name.  After not hearing any more on the subject, I figured that was that.  \n\nSince those first few videos (so, within the past 15 months), there hasn\u2019t been anything that could even be misconstrued as inappropriate as far as I can tell.  Take today for example. I\u2019ve got no clue who posted it. I don\u2019t know who any of these people that are making comments are. I am just a dude sitting in his room right now, writing raps and contemplating masturbation.  My videos get posted, and people upvote them and comment on them. I don\u2019t know who these people are, but I certainly am thankful for their support. I am however, getting a little bit bothered by these allegations that I\u2019m a scam or a cheat, because people talk about it so matter-of-factly, yet I\u2019m sitting here just thinking \u201cwhat on earth are these people even talking about?\u201d   I take pride in the fact that there's no machine behind me. It's just me. So it kind of rubs me the wrong way to be accused of being the opposite of that.\n\nIn conclusion, if it\u2019s really that wrong to inform a few of your friends from home that your video is on reddit and available to be upvoted, I hope you forgive my past ignorance to such a thing.   It seemed like a normal way for one to behave. However, in learning that it apparently is not, I put a stop to it over a year ago. And anything you are seeing now, like with this new video, is just reddit being reddit - and upvoting what they like.  I have no control over any voting or comments posted here, but if I still haven't convinced you guys then please downvote the video and move on.  I just want to put a stop to idea that I am somehow scamming anyone, or that any of the response reddit has had to my videos isn't genuine.  \n\nI will be on the move the rest of today, but I am doing my first AMA tomorrow.  Feel free to ask me any more questions you might have about this tomorrow.

I was completely unfamiliar with the practices of reddit and had no idea this could ever possibly be considered an issue.  Once I was told that this was a problem, i told people to stop.  This all happened after my 2nd or 3rd video released, and as far as i'm told, happened in the videos section of reddit, not even your own sub.  You say my friends gamed the system, but that was maybe 10 people, within the first month of my existence on youtube.  You say my fans gamed the system, but isn\u2019t the entire point of the system that users submit content and vote it up or down based on whether they like it? So if I have a lot of fans on this website, wouldn\u2019t it make complete fucking sense that my content would consistently do well?  How is this gaming the system? It IS the system.

A while ago, it was brought to my attention that I was being accused of creating fake accounts for upvotes, or gaming the system so to speak. Today, I was told the same issue keeps being brought up so I wanted to respond directly to all of this, because it\u2019s entirely untrue. I don\u2019t really understand where these accusations are coming from, but allow me to explain my history with Reddit, and perhaps it will clear things up.\nIronically, I\u2019ve been pretty unfamiliar with reddit for my entire life, up until my music videos began being posted. I had obviously heard about it, but didn\u2019t really know what it was, or actively reddit or anything. Back in the day, when my first video (ex-boyfriend) was posted and doing well on reddit, I posted on my personal facebook account, informing my friends of such, and saying \u201cgo upvote it if you get the chance!\u201d or something of that nature. I did it without any knowledge that something like that was \u201cagainst the rules\u201d or frowned upon on reddit. Remember, this is a guy who doesn\u2019t know a thing about the site or how it works at that point in time. In my mind, it made sense to have a few friends support the cause, the way they do when they share my videos on their facebooks and stuff. I assume about 10 friends of mine ended up making an account, and upvoted the first few videos that came out within a month of my existence on the internet. As soon as I got wind that this was actually frowned upon, I immediately told them to stop. So, at the height of this alleged scandal, it wasn\u2019t more than 10-15 friends of mine casually upvoting my first month\u2019s worth of content when something got posted on reddit. Nothing beyond that. I imagine out of the tens of thousands of upvotes that those videos received, my friends\u2019 impact was rather negligible. I think my videos are just designed to do well on user-driven platforms like reddit. Around that time, I was also contacted by a mod who wanted to hear my side of things given it was repeatedly being suggested that I was using fake accounts. I told him all the same things I am telling you guys here, figured he would try to get to the bottom of it, and hopefully clear my good name. After not hearing any more on the subject, I figured that was that.\nSince those first few videos (so, within the past 15 months), there hasn\u2019t been anything that could even be misconstrued as inappropriate as far as I can tell. Take today for example. I\u2019ve got no clue who posted it. I don\u2019t know who any of these people that are making comments are. I am just a dude sitting in his room right now, writing raps and contemplating masturbation. My videos get posted, and people upvote them and comment on them. I don\u2019t know who these people are, but I certainly am thankful for their support. I am however, getting a little bit bothered by these allegations that I\u2019m a scam or a cheat, because people talk about it so matter-of-factly, yet I\u2019m sitting here just thinking \u201cwhat on earth are these people even talking about?\u201d I take pride in the fact that there's no machine behind me. It's just me. So it kind of rubs me the wrong way to be accused of being the opposite of that.\nIn conclusion, if it\u2019s really that wrong to inform a few of your friends from home that your video is on reddit and available to be upvoted, I hope you forgive my past ignorance to such a thing. It seemed like a normal way for one to behave. However, in learning that it apparently is not, I put a stop to it over a year ago. And anything you are seeing now, like with this new video, is just reddit being reddit - and upvoting what they like. I have no control over any voting or comments posted here, but if I still haven't convinced you guys then please downvote the video and move on. I just want to put a stop to idea that I am somehow scamming anyone, or that any of the response reddit has had to my videos isn't genuine.\nI will be on the move the rest of today, but I am doing my first AMA tomorrow.

Simple things. I'd like to see some buildings fixed up. I'd like to see sidewalk constructed in areas where we currently don't have any. I'd like to see some new businesses (like the Point Motel to be sold to a new developer). Things like that.\n\nFinancials are always a challenge. We have no shortage of ideas for projects to improve the Village, it's finding the money to make them reality that's the tricky part. That's why for large scale projects, we always look for state or federal funding. We simple cannot ask the 900-some residents who pay property taxes here to constantly fund large scale projects. Whitney Point has been very fortunate and received a number of grants in the last decade or so that have made a huge impact here. \n\nAs for actual changes in implementation, in 2016 we implemented the PILOT program tax exempt entities that I would like to see grow and become ingrained in the Village operation. And ideally I would also like to see some of the Village's reserve funds grow so that the Village can remain prepared for rainy economic days, major catastrophes and large projects. Obviously we aren't just going to jack everyone's taxes up in order to do that, we have to find more creative ways.\n\nOne of the things that we're currently working on is implementing some changes to our zoning code which will create a unified process for the installation of solar panels and electric vehicle charging stations in residential garages. NYSERDA is offering $5,000 in incentives for us to do so. That's how we have to work for our taxpayers. We have to find little ways to save money and boost revenues every way that we can. There are no grandiose silver bullets that I have found. \n\nAs far as the funding goes, we try to take advantage of the programs that the state offers. To my knowledge there aren't any grants that we can apply for that would net our school district $800,000 to bolster educational programs. The school district can certainly seek grants but as a Mayor of a municipal government, I'm not authorized to apply for them. That said, I do believe that education and housing are two of the best investments that the public can make. That's why I'm very excited about the $500,000 housing rehabilitation grant that we have been awarded. The improvements made through the grant will directly improve quality of life for our residents who receive money to fix their homes, the Village's presentation will improve and property values will increase. All long term benefits. That's the definition of investment.\n\nAs for the look out/public space, that's a qualify of life improvement that we think will attract more people to Whitney Point. When you drive through and see it you'll say, \"This looks like a nice place to live.\" It will make you want to come back. It will make you consider us when you're looking for a new home. I think it would be a good investment for NYS to fund. \n\nSo that said, we can only take advantage of the programs that are out there. If NYS wants to change the programs that are available, that is their choice. But if I'm told that NYS is looking to fund building rehab, we're going to try to take advantage of that rather than let the money go elsewhere. We want to bring it to our community and to our residents, who pay NYS taxes like everyone else. \n\nAs for the specific grades, I don't have info on the criteria used but I often find the criteria used isn't suitable to smaller communities.

We once had a high speed chase and man hunt in the Village while I was in a car on vacation with my girlfriend. I spent much of the car ride answering people's questions on Facebook, posting updates, talking to the police on the phone, etc. You have to do what you have to do and you just have to remember that your duties to your residents are always on-going. It also helps to have family, friends and a spouse/partner who is supportive and understanding. I'm very lucky in that regard.\n2.

While not everyone always agrees with me and I don't always agree with everyone else, we generally have great discussions and respect each other. I think we all know that we all care about our community, even when we disagree on what's best. We have a mutual respect there and it helps us a governing body. I think we also recognize that we all bring something different to the table.\n4. I do agree with the idea of Villages in New York and I'll tell you why. Our Village in particular provides essential services to our residents at very reasonable prices. Our water and sewer prices are well below the state average. Our property taxes are generally lower than many of our municipal peers. We have a volunteer fire department that is very dedicated, well managed and efficient. While there is always room for improvement and new methods, I am very confident that we offer our tax payers a high level of services at very reasonable rates. I don't believe that dissolving the Village and laying those operations in the hands of a mystery body would benefit our residents. \n5. I go out all the time. Most of our residents feel comfortable reaching out to me on Facebook or emailing me when they need something and often note that I am very quick to respond. I actually like that and pride myself on that. People need to know that you're there for them. The only times that I really like to be isolated are when I'm at the gym, relaxing playing a videogame, watching a movie for the first time, or something along those lines.

And you can't really argue that many costs have gone up. They have. But why have they gone up? In my totally unprofessional, uneducated opinion it's because the policies that are available are actually worth a damn now. Before Obamacare you could buy a cheap insurance policy that didn't really do much for you. If something serious happened they'd just boot you from the policy and you'd be out in the cold. Now, you're being offered polices that cost more because they are worth more. If you go to the store and you want a bag of Doritos you can get a small bag for $1.49. But if you want more Doritos you need the bigger bag, which costs $4.00. You're paying more because you're getting more.\n\nNow I'm not saying that the cost part is right or wrong for anyone. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Do you think the market should be free to offer whatever policies they want or do you want guarantees that drive the price up? That's up to each individual.

It's always hard to relate funny stories. But I'm so happy that that is a film that has gotten a lot of attention over the years.

That, you know, FARGO was their first film that really broke into the mainstream. Probably any other filmmakers would have followed that film with something as equally as commercial, and they decided to go with THE BIG LEBOWSKI. And I think it took years for that film to develop a following. I think it took a good 5 years before people would stop me on the street, and talk to me about it.

But I know a part of the character was based on a fellow named Jeff Dowd, and you know, I worked on the Dude the way I worked on most characters, where you read the script & it starts to tell you a lot about the way a character is, and the Coen brothers being such masters, you can get so much just by reading the script.

The KOAN brothers.\" And then he went on to say all these different lines like \"The Dude abides\" or \"Shut the fuck up, Donny\" - like taking ancient koans and bringing them into modern times.

Anyways, i wanted to respond to you dude:\n\n1. Totally agree, that venue was NUTS! 22,000 people in one room = BONKERS! If i did it again, we would have just made it more clear [can\u2019t imagine how] where all the free water was, and somehow INSTANTLY waved a magic wand and got everyone through the line at once.

I listened to our sound board recording today and kept getting chills. \n\nAnyone who complained about the music this NYE: you just don\u2019t like Bassnectar. and that\u2019s fine :)\n\npersonally i fucking love it :)\ni love every second of every track, and that\u2019s why i played it :)\n\n\n2. You are so right, after every big event, its a storm of critique and complaining. Fortunately, i have learned how to tune out, so i don\u2019t have to deal with it. But i feel bad for y\u2019all. If i was you i would want to float out of the event filled with bliss and just glow for a while without some dummie trying to shit on the vibe. I think the biggest problem with the critics is:\n\n- they are so often literally inaccurate\n- they speak with absolute authority, which makes their glaring inaccuracies unbearable\n- they feel some kind of entitlement to weigh in, which they shouldn\u2019t\n- i literally DON\u2019T WANT their feedback. nobody is asking them\n\ndon\u2019t tell an artist what to play. i play what i love, if you don\u2019t like it please leave :)\n\nits so simple.\n\nMy music is my art. I am an artist. You don\u2019t tell an artist what to do, that\u2019s so ridiculous. You either enjoy the art, or you GTFO\u2026go make your own art, i don\u2019t know. Go to some other show.\n\nIf i was at an art gallery where i didnt like the art, the last thing in the worrrrrrld i would do is try and tell people how the artist could have or should have done it differently. i\u2019d just leave. and go to another exhibit, or go make art, or go chill, whatever\u2026 but why be ugly?\n\n3. I really appreciate what you said: i can drop whatever I want. and i do. and i always have. often many moons before it\u2019s popular, and i\u2019m willing to bet many moons before you heard it. Years before you started saying \u201ctrap\u201d i was \u2018dropping trap\u2019. I\u2019d bet that years before you knew what filth was, i was dropping it. now that sounds cocky as hell, but i\u2019m just saying it for real. I was also mashing it up with melodic downtempo, or vocal samples i loved, or whatever\u2026 i was just playing whatever TF i enjoy, and whatever I felt the desire to play. And I always will. musical freedom is essential to creativity. I am not catering to anyone, and in fact decided today i\u2019m gonna take down the request line because i don\u2019t want these kids misunderstanding: i play what i want, its my art :)\n\nSo the wannabe OG kid with his heady wrap on sitting in a Motel 6 trying to tell you about how many shows he has been to and why nectar sucks now, the irony is that THOSE are the guys i literally cannot waiiiiiiiiiit to get rid of\u2026.because that is definitely not a true fan or a real bass head. If he was a real bass head, he would know how important it is to be kind when you have the opportunity, to open your arms and welcome new and different people in, to explore and adventure into new sounds, and to expect the unexpected. He would also know i will never cater my music to him or to anyone, and if he is a fan, he should enjoy it. If not, BY ALL MEANS that dude should go somewhere else.\n\nI literally remember last New Years in Birmginham, the next day i hear several people saying \u201cman he played too much original music, it was too predictable\u201d [i had not even noticed that, or considered that] and then this year, they were all caught off guard and now they are complaining they don\u2019t recognize it or\u2026whatever they complain about, i honestly don\u2019t know because i make it a habit to not focus on their nonsense or bad attitudes.\n\ni just really love what you said man, and hopefully you wake up the real fans: after a gigantic magical celebration just ENJOY yourselves!!!! focus on what you love\u2026.\n\nlife is so short, stop trying to complain: if you are complaining about the music i play you are literally the exact person I do not want at my shows.\n\nSo Glompulin, thank you dude for saying all that :)\n\nNow i saw someone say something really dumb below and i need to go tell him\u2026\n\n\n", "length": 4862, "utc_timestamp": 1514951659.0, "subreddit": "r/bassnectar", "score": {"compound": 295, "ups": 295, "downs": 0}, "vader": {"neg": 0.095, "neu": 0.718, "pos": 0.187, "compound": 0.9986}}, {"text": "At many points in the past ten years I have been so immersed in Bassnectar that there is little room for anything else.

Those kind of people need to leave because they are the opposite of my vibe. \n\nBy the way when I write \u201cyou\u201d I don\u2019t mean that to you \u201czenmaster7\u201d (haha these fuckin profile names\u201d) I meant it to the trolls. \n\nThis shit is nearly\nImpossible to communicate about clearly and it seems people miss the point. \n\nThe point is find what you love and love it.

I would say that comedians often get way too much credit or criticism about the type of stand up they're going to do anyway. \n\nI'm considered a \"clean comedian\" or \"family friendly comedian,\" but that's just how it comes out. There's no incredible calculation behind being clean or family friendly; comedians talk about what they can get away with. Chris Rock or Lewis Black are just gonna do the type of comedy that they're going to do. If you know them, it makes sense what type of comedy that they're doing. I'm always hesitant to be identified as a clean comedian because all comedians, whether they be clean, female or African American or transgender, the only adjective they want is to be funny. \n\nI sometimes I feel as though \"clean\" is this asterisk that kind of disqualifies some of my success. People are not coming to see me do stand up because I don't curse. Hopefully they're coming because it's funny. We don't live in a society where cursing is that pervasive, where me not cursing is someone anomaly, *but* I have been asked that before but it's not some calculation. By the way, I do believe comedians don't have to please a large audience.  \n\nWhen I started stand up in the early 1800s, the task was to make people laugh. People that don't like you or people that you don't have in common, you're supposed to make everyone laugh. That's not to say that you're supposed to appeal to everyone but the premise was not to just appeal to a certain group of people; you're supposed to be funny for a lot people. The idea is the make the whole room laugh, you're never going to get the whole room, but even if people look at you and don't like you, the material should be strong enough to make them laugh. \n\nAnyway my point is, I'm a great guy. \n", "length": 1836, "utc_timestamp": 1465838884.0, "subreddit": "r/IAmA", "score": {"compound": 423, "ups": 423, "downs": 0}, "vader": {"neg": 0.045, "neu": 0.701, "pos": 0.254, "compound": 0.9979}}, {"text": "I think I'm very mindful of when people come to one of my shows, that I want them leaving with the thought that not only they enjoyed the show, but that they're gonna want to come back, when I come back in like two years or whatever.
